being overwhelmed with the saud, which is so very line as to resemble that
used in Englaud in honr-glasses. After three c tere of prelimiuary matter
of intense interest, M. Bremontier‚ in his fourth c a ter, gives an account of
the manner in which he proceeded, not only to lix is sea of san but to
render it productive of timber, resin, and other articles. This process is as
remarkable 1οι its simplicity as for its complete success. lt consiste iu sowing
on the surface secde of the common broom, mixed with those of thum Pi·
nister3 commencingon the side next the sea, or on that from which the
wind generally prevails, and sowing in narrow eones, in a directiou at right
angles to that of the wind3 the first-sonu cone being protected hya line of
hurdles, this zone protecting the second, the smond the third, and so on, riu
the whole hreadth 01 the downs in that locality is covered with plantation.
From tto. tobihel 1ιιοοιιι seed, and from llh. to alb. 01 pinaster seed,
are sowu per sere,and immediately covered with branches of pinea, or 01
other trees, with the leaves on, brought from the nearest woods, in order to
shelterand rotect the seed, and, by the help of the hurdle fenoe, to retain
the saud. ihese branches are laid down in a regular manner in the direction
of the wind, and overlapping oue another, so as to produce a sort 01 thatching
to the surface; and, iu places very much exposed, rods are laid across them,
and lirmly hoolred down. ln aword, wherever seeds are sowu, the surface of
the downs, as far aa the sowing extends, rnay be said to be oarefully thatehed;
branches of evergreen trees being used instead of straw. lu six weelts or two
months, the broom seeds have produced plents diu. in height, end which
