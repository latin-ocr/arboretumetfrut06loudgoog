The Siloer Fir in Britr'vh Plantntiom. Though the silver fir has been planted
insomeinstances, in Britaimin measa, with a view ιο producing timber, yet its
principaluse has been as an ornaments] tree. Before thecedarnf Lebanon be-
came ιο common, or was known tobe so hardy asit hae been since found to be,
the silver lir was planted near mansions,as a choica and a striking trce, which,
as the cedar does now, might distinguish the residence os the large lauded
proprietor l'rom those of his more humble neighbours. This it did, 'not only

the pictoresque. Gilpin says: “ The silver fir has very little to boast in point
of prouisaque beauty. lt has all the regrrlarity nithe spruce, but without its
hosting foliage There is a sort ol harah, stili', uubeuding forntality in the
stem, the branches, and in the whole economy of the tree, which malros it

shattered tres,linely adorned with ivy, and shooting out a l'ew horizontal
branchos, on which its meagre foliage and tusted moes appear to advantage.
l may add that the silver fir is, perhaps, the hardiest of ita tribe. It wssl ont·
lace the south-west wind; it will bear, without shriuhiag, even the sea air:
so that one advantage, at least, attende a plantation ol silver lira; you ny
have it where you can have no other; and a plantation of silves hrs may be

better than no plantation at all.” (For. δια. i. parm& “ Aa ιο the pictu-

large aize on soils of a very opposite description; but a leani, rather rich and
deep then otherwise, appears ιο suit it best. lt has attained its greatest
height, in soils of this description, at Studley and Castle Howard3 but it has
also attained a very great height in sandy lnam at Woburn Ahbey, and on clay,
incumbent on aretentive clayey snbsoil, at Panmure. It isin vain, says Bout-
