possible to extend their cultivation beyond a very limited number or spaeeiu
any one year. They were at first planted very little tbiclter on the ground,
among other trees, than they would have been, bad they been thinned out to
stand l'or naval purposes. Generally‚ in mixed plantations, they were put
in from 700 to 1000 planta peracre. ln the first attempta at plauting them
entirely by themselves, 100 were increased only to 1500 plants per acre, from
the want 01 plants. The lesping 01 100 plants in the nursery grounds till
they were 3 and 4 years transplanted from the seed-bed, tended greatly to
decresse the disposable quantity 01 planta srom such sources. Fintling 1500
planta rather too lew among broom and lirrze, they were increased to 1800
per acre. Even alter one-year-old seedlings were planted, which praedes
