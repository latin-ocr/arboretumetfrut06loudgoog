mouths, with every moderate hear, and probably much soonm, aa the next
circumstance to be noted seems to show. When wood can lose no more
weight, we take it for granted it is perfectly seasuned; and, as this is so
aponkpttsined by the larch, there can remam no just apprehensione of its

“ ⁵. Larcir is much more tough than foreign deal. lt splits with great
difficulty, and never in any length with the grain. Foreign deal being so
cxceedingly apt to split, can seldnrn be used very thinr but the larch may
be used as thin as the sawyers can cut it, without any danger on that head.

A larch post, which, in 1800, iad been in the ground upwards of years,
was perfectly sound above ground, and unt decayed under it deeper than the
sap wood; and, where the berk was not removed under ground, even therap
wond was nninjured. (For. Paua, ed. 4, p. 83.)

llIutthem is the next British author who writes on the uses of the larch
from his own experience; and his work On Ναοαὶ flander is dated 1831.
The larch, compared with pines and firs, he says, hat the timber much
stronger when young, and even when the trunlr is under a foot in diameter,
than when old and large. Near the top of the trec, the timber is very
inferior, und deficient in toughness, ιο what it is at the root. 'fhe wood is
finer gruned, and has fewer large lsnots, than that of the Scotch plne. Athin
larch heard, when dried,isat once strong, tough, durabis, aad extremely light
lt is difficult ιο split lerch even by wedges; which is owing to the netted
metare of the libres of the wood: whereas the wood of the Scotch plne,
aa of other pines, is easily split, owing ιο its reedy structure, the longitudinal
fihree running parallel to each other, with corn arativel very few transverse
ones. Some experimenta conducted at Wooiivich, wdich will be hesealler
given, show the strength of Highland larch to beto thet of the Riga pine
as 1000 to 8043 and to that of white American pinc (P. ducibus), as 1000 ιο

pinet as a proof of which, the sawyert nployed ιο cut it np have one fourth
