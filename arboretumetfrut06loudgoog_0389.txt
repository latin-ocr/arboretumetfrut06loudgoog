trees,” he says, “are from Βῆ. to 16 ll. French, in circumference, and
their height erceeds 50ft. Freneh. I suppose,” he addas, “that they owe
their preservatiou to their being situated on a mountain difficult of access,
and at a distance from towns where their wood could be used, and to which
hom their present habitat, it could now be only transported on the backs
of animus? (Ana. Sorba. Nat, 2. a, vol. i. p. 235.) The cedar has also been
lstely discovered on Mouut Atlas, whence eones, and specimens of the
branches, leaves, and wood, have been sent by ΜΓ. Druinmond Hay, the
British consul at Tangier, to ΜΓ. Lambertv and specimeus have also been
received from Morocco by P. B. Webb, Esq. The rohability is, that the
range of the tree not only extends over the whole olp that group of moun-
tains which is situated between Damascus and Tri oli in Syria, and which
includes the Libanus and Mounts Amanus and Taurus of antiquity, and
variam other mountains, but that its distribution on the mountaiuoua re·

Theophrastus and Plin maha it a native of Egypt, Crete, Cyprus: &c.; “
but, ss they included the juuipers, aud probably several other trees, under
the general name of Cadrns, no reliance can be placed on their testimony.
The cedar has been said by some authors, both Continental and British,
to be a native of Mounts Amanus and Taurus, and of Siberia; but, though
the first statement is probably true, the second, as will herealter be shown,
is decidedl erroneous. Loiseleur Deslongchamps in the Noaoeau Da
Hamel, an Baudrillnrt in the Dictionnairc der Eone et Fordtr, inform us
that Belou found the cedar groningon Mouut Amanus and Mouut Taurus;
and that Pallas states, in his Observabant saites dont an Voyoge, &c.,thst
he found it in the countries between the Wolga and the Tobol, in Siberis,
and on the Altaic Mouutains, Baudrillart adding that he had been informed
by a Ruscino officer in the administration of the foresta, that the wood of tha
cedere found in Siberis was so sofr and so brittle, as to be unfit for the con·
struction of ships. Mt. Lambert also quotes Pallas, to prove that the eadm,
in Siberis, does not thrive so well in dryas in moist ground.

Belou, who wrote about 1550, mentions the cedar among the ‘⁴ singulari-
ties'’ observed by him during his travels in the East (see Les Obiere, dre,
p. 162. 166.); and states that it grows not only on Mouut Libanus, “on which
someremain even to this day, planted, as it is thought, by Solomon himself 3 ’'
but also ‘⁸ on the mountains Taurus and Amanus, in cold stony places.'’
He adds that the merchants of the factory of Tri oli, in Syria, told him
that “the cedar grew on the declivity of Mouut lichanon next that city,
and that the inhabitants of Syria made boats of it, for want of the pioe
trec.” In Belon’s hestiae, De Arboribus Cmasen's, published in 1553, the
author says he was told that the cedar of Solomou is found on MountLe·
hanon, and also on Amanus and Taurus, and on the mountains above Nicea3
but nowhere in the lale ef Crete. He theu mentions several kinds of juniper,
all of which he calls cedars; and states it to be his opinion, that the great
cedar of Mouut Lebanon was not the wood used for building Solomon‘s
temple. f p. iv.) In another p e, after relating his visit to Mouut Lebanon,
he says, ‘⁶ Right true aud excel ent are the trees of Mouut Lebanon.” He
afterwards describes their appearanceand mode of growth, adding:“ The cedars
that we saw on Amanm au Taurus were very similar to these. They grow in
moist places, like thosein which the spruce rir(picea, Albies L.) delights; and
they are also found in moist valleys t—Cedros quas in Amano et Tauro vidi·
mus, eandem curn praedictis habere similitudinem comperimus. In humidis nati
quemadmodum picea, oblectatur, atque etiarn convalles humorem habentes
