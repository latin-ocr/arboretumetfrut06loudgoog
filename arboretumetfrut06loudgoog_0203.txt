tween that city and Bayonne, which are there called pignadas, constitute '

the principa! siches of the inhabitants, who are almost entirely supported by
tbe preparation of resin and tar from the pinaster foresta.

Propertier aad Uret. Thongh the wood of the pinaster is soft, and not of
long duration, it is employed, m the marine arsenal at Toulon, for the outer
cases of all the packages which are ut on board vessels, and princ' lly for
the piles and propa which are used fiir sustaining the frames of vossiia while
they are being constructed. ln Bordeaux and m Provence, it is employed
for the common kinds of carpentry, for packingboxes, and for fuel; hut
the most valnable purposes to which the tres is applied in these countries ia
the productiori of redo, tar, and lampblack.

Mode qsproeuriug tte resinous Producit os tte Piasrter. Thesauro obtained
chiefly in the province of (luienne, from the trees which grow on the immense
tract of sandy soil extending along the sea coast from Bayonne to Mddoc in
one direction, and from the sesto tbeborders of the river Garonne in the
other. When the trees ltave attained the age of from 25 to 30 years, with
trunks about stt. in circumferente, the are thought to have acquired suffi-
cient strength to bear the extraction of their sap. The maner (which is the
name given to the person who collecta the resin) usually testa the tree, by
putting his arm round it, and if the trturk is so thick that he cantmt see his
fingere on the other side, he considers the tree of sufficientsiae for him to com-
mence his operatione. This he does by first stripping off a piece of the outer
berk from a s ace of about din. o'r dm. wide, and from lain. to lssin. long.
A hollow is then cut in the lower part of the trunk, with a hatchet slightly
curved like a bill-hook, in such a manner as to retain the fluid resin to the
extent of about halfe pint ; or a small trough is attached to the bottom of the
channel formed by the removal of the bark. From this reservoir, in a directiou

onzes out from between the bark and the wood,and runs into the reser-
voir, from which it is taken with wooden or iron infles, or is conducted by the
trough to a vessel proper to receive it. Every week‚ the person employed to
perform the operation has occasion to reopen the wound, and slightly in·
cresse its height and breadth, without, however, ever exceeding lain. iu
length in the course of the asason. These successive cnts are requirite,
because the resinous matter tiows more freely from new wounds than
old ones3 but, aa thc slightest touch is found sufficient, the operator shouhl
be careful not to injure the trec more than is necessary. This work re·
guires activity, aa one man is nerally expected to be able to managa

it is conducted gradually to the same height as the other. Alter this,
other eltannels are successively cut, till the operator has completely en·
circled the trce; by which tima, the first wounds are so well healed ss
tube ready to be cut again, if the operator has done his work properly.
When the trees are to be thinned, those destined to be removed are cut into
numerous channels all round the tree at once, and three times the height of
those usually made, and this is continued for two or three years together ς
after which the trees arexeut down and burned, to extract their tar. This

When arrived at the necessary height, he twuts his left leg round the pole
and the tree, thus holding them firmly together, and then testing his right
foot in one of the notchcs, he uses both lus hands to cut the tree, as before
