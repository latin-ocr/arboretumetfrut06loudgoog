This dhease ia found 111 trees growing in 01 wet tilis, aad in 1101, sandy,
mooriah soils, with a retentive aiibsoil. ‘⁴ Τ e fact that the red pine in Scot-
land has iewer sap wood la ersthan the red pine of Memel or of North
Amerina, and also the fact tlat, in most situations in Scotland, the red pine
soon deca s, and soonest in the places where the trees have seweat sap wood
layers, aad where the timber has been planted, that is, where the eones hare
been kilndried, are worthy 01 notice. Scotch red ine has generally from
14 ιο 4011γο10 Memel, from 40 ιο 503 Canadian, olen 100. We consider
the long, meiat, open winter, and cold ungenial spring in Scotlartd, and the
till bottoma soalnng with water, perhaps aided ογ the transplanting, and the
kilndryr'ng ot* the oonea, 10 be the cuusee os thia early loss of vitality or change
of sap wood into niatured wood. In Poland an Prusae, the earth does
11οι remain ao long cold aad meist as in Scotland, but ia either srozeu, 01
sufficiently warin and dry: this occurs even ιο a greater degree in Canada;
, and neither the Memel nor Ganadian trees liare any chance of being planted, 01
the seeds kilndried.” (On Nave! lhuber, p. 75.) In mountainouscountries,
und in countries subject to heavy talis of snow, the Scotch pineis liableto
the accidente which we have mentioned (p. 2136.) aa common to the order
generally; and not only foresta take sire, but also single trees. Aremarliable
instance ot' this last kind 01 accident is noticed by Dr. Howison, who visited
the north of Ruasia in 18183 and who, having observed many large treea 011οο
Pinus sylvestris standing ercet in the forest, in a withered, and f nently iii
n dead state, was led to examine into the reason. He was nota ittle sur·
prised to find that, iii many casea, although the berk was entire, the interior

part or wood of the trec was in a great measure charred. On enquiry, he
ound that this was occasioned by the uavelling boore, in the sultr dry wea-

ther of sumner,seeliing the shade of large trees, and making sires or dressing
their victuale about the roots 01 the trees. Many 01 these roots lie near the
aurface; and, aa they abound very much with resinous matter, they readily
catch fire. The fire seems 10 be propagated slowly, as in match papan a
gradual and stifled combustion creeps onwards, encouraged ογ the drought,
aad constantlyl'ed hythe empyreumatic oil oi turpentine (or tar), which is
produced ογ 1110 heat, until the interior 01 1110 11111111 itaelf be destroyed.
(Junieson's Journal, iv. p. 1107)- We have given these ample details on the
subject of the Scotch piae, considering it by fur the most valuable timber
tree of the genua in Britain, and even in Europe.
