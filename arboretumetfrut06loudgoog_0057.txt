ebbe wss founded in 1132, by Thurston, Archbishop of York, for certain
monis, who separated themselves from the benedictine Abbey ol St. Msry’s,
in York,in order to edopt the more severe discipline ol St. bernard, who hed
just then founded tbe Cistertien order at (lleirvoux, in Chsmpcgnc. The
history oi Founteins Abbey is minutely related by Burton, from the nerre-
tive ol' Hugh, e monk ol Kirkstell, which is said to be now preserved in the
librery ol the Roynl Society:-“AtChrist1nns, the archbisho , being et
Ripon, assigned to the monlrs some land in the petrimony olP St. Peter,
about three miles west of thet place, for the erecting of e monastery. This
spot ol ground hed never been rubebited, unless by wild bessts3 being over·
grown with wood end brembles, lying between two stecp bills end rocks,

covered with wood on all sides, more roper for s retreat sor wild hesstc

Skell, from e rivu et oltbst neme running through it from the west to the
eestwsrd pert. The prior of St. Mary’s, et Yor , was choeen ebbot by the
moglts, being the first of this monastery of Fountains, with whom they
withdrew into this uncouth desert, without any house to shelter them in
thet winter sesson, or provisions to subsist on, but entirely depending on
Divine Providence. There stood s lorge elm tree in the midst of the vele,
on the lower bruncbes of which they put some thetch end strew; end under

their elrn lor tbst ol seven yew trees, growing on the dechvity ol the hill on
the south side ol the ebbey, nll standing et this present time (1658), except
the lergest, which wss blown down about the middle ol the last century.
They ere oi extraordinary size: the munli os one ol them is 2611. 6in. in
