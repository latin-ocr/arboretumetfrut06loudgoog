The larch has fine and minute leaves, and, of all trees which sbed their leaves,
it must present a less snrsacer consequently‚ the action ol these surlaces must
be greater to produce the same results. Larcbes generally thrive on the de-
clivrties ol' our mountains, seldom on liat places; because on declivities there
is always a little dampness in the earth, descending from the suriace above3
and, at the earne time, the trees, on account of the inequality ol their b'ases,
have more space at their tops, and are better exposed to the light ς whereas
ilat places are elien too dry, and the trees, being all ol the same height, over-
shsdow esch other. Among declivities, those which are connected with
summits covered with erpetual suow are those where larchesgrow best;
becanae there they are skghtly and continuelly watered by the madual meltin
ol the snow during summer, and, attha same nme, theirheads are wellexposel
to the sun. Dechvities, and, in general, elevated countries, suit larches best;
because the action of the lightis more intense there than in low countries:
yet the larch succeeds well enough in situations only a little elevated above
the level ol the sea, provided the atmospbere be not obscured by fogs and
constant cloudiness. 1f the larcb seems to like to have its rootsin a soil
moderatcly damp, it likes also to avoid the dampness ol tbe atmosphere. On
that account, it grows badly near lakes, rivers, cascades, and under the sbade
of rocks, eren in those countries where, in other situations, it would llourish.
We are here (Genera) very near the countries where the larch mous beauti-

causes which makes it pros there. The dampness ol' thenit tends to
diminish the evaporation of theg leaves, which is so necessary to the health
and vigam of the trec. It has been remarked that the lsrch does not grow
well near the sea, which proves what 1 have just advanced. The sea pro·
duces an increase of dampness in the air in two ways: lst, like the surface
oi fresh water, it exhalas much molstureinto the atmosphere3 2dly, tbe watery
particles which are thrown ont by the waves are carried here end there, and

de sited on all solid bodies3 and, when the molsture they contain evaporates,
it lekves behind a certain quantity ol salt, more or less deliquescent (muriates
of lime and soda), which constantly attracta dampness.

“ ln Switaerland, the larch grows better in those parts exposed to the north'
than to the south. The difference is sometimes so striking, that in the
valleys parallel to the equator, it is not rareto see all the side to the north
covered with larches, and none at all to the south. lam inclined to believe

that this arises stom the irregularity os our spring, which causes the buda of
the larchcstobe too precocious on the southern declivities; and, cons uently,
they are frequently killed by the frost. In the latitude of Great ritaip,
where the springis more regular, Ι think this cause will not operate; and 1
should say that, if the southern declivities henot too dry, the larches will
succeed better there than here.'' (Quart. Joum. of Aga, vol. v. p. 409.)

Sang mentions it as a fact ascertained by expericnce, that the larch thrives
best in inland and elevated situations. lt will not,he says, “growupto
