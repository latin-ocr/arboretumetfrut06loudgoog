Τὴο roots of the rbitrinae differ from those of almost all other trees, in not
descending perpendicularlyy but, both in young and old trees, spreading
along the surface ol thegrounm and, very genersll 2 after the trees have
atturned some age, swellrng and appesrinp above it. l'hey are numerous, and
of less thickness in roportion to thato the nunu than in the case of any
other trees, except e palms; but, being near the surface, and often partially
above it, they are of c more to b sud woody natiue, and are, consequently,
better able to resist the action o the wind on the head of the tree, than rn

consequently much less tougb and wood . ll'he vitality ol the roots of some
