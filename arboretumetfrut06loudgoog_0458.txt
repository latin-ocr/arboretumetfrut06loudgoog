os the great swnmps, which bevenot been thoroughly explored. When the
white cadara grow close to er, the trunk is straight, perpendicular, and
destitute ol' branchos ιο the eight of boll. or diist. The barli is very thiu
on oun trees; but on older trees it become thick, os a reddish colonr,
an simdar to that ol' an old vine. When cut, e yellow usurparent resin
exudes from it, ol' an agreeahle odour, burin such small quandum, that only
slew ouncea could be collected in the course os e summer, from accesit
in diameter. The wood is light, soh, fine-grainan and eesily worked. When
perlectly sessoned, and aher ir has been some time exposed ιο the light, it
rs ol' a rosy hue. Ῑι has a strong aromatis odom, which it preserves as lo
as it isgnarded from humidity ι and it resista the alternations of dryness sn
moisture longer than the wood of nu other speciesof American trec. The
concentric crrcles are always perfecdy distinct, even in trunks οἰ considas·-

’ Ge luy, Hr'rtory, dc. ln America, the white cedar grows only in wet
groun s sn the maritime districts ol New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginis,
where it nearly fills the extensive marshes which lre edjacent ιο the salt mea-
