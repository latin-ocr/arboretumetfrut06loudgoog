elevated. P. sylvestris, and some others es, will grow ln bleak exposed
rimations on lofty mountains ς and P. ,audathers belonging to that
section of Pinus, will endure the aea hreeze: hut, in general, wherever
the Abictinae arcto be exposed, they require to be planted together in messes,
so as to shelter one another. Nune of the macies, however, become orna-
mental when so planted, because they necessarily lose their side branches,

&epagatum The only mode of propagating the ine aud firtribeon a
large scale is by seedst but all the species will succeed hy layers, by inarching
on closely allied kinds, and by herbaceous grahing3 and many, if not all, may
also bc propagated by cuttings. That the Abiennae might be propagated hy
layers aud cuttings was known in the time of Evelyn, and was “ divulged
hy hina,>“as sconsiderahle secret.” Cook, also, mentions these modes of
little tlibi ltlllzftttl‘ttTddllttlltlbltd
Society’s Garden, and in the Fulham aud other aurseiies, upwards of twenty
different species of the Abiednae are propagated hy cutdags with themam
perfect sacceam the planta, in most cases, hemming as haudsome trees
as' ifthcy had been raised from secd. The only exce tione to this result
are, where the plant hecom bushy, aud does not row np every de-
cided leading shoot; but this can always be obtained by pegging the branches
down to the ground, and leaving the sohar fully exposed; whence one
armore ‘ rous shoots will uot fail to he produced, from which nleader
may be ected, aud all the others kept p ed down for a year or two
longer, aud afterwards cut away b degrees. &a have no doubt that, by this
manner of treatment, a plant of e little stunted monstrosity of the spruce
fir, called Abies Claubrasilidua, might he restored to the natural form and
magnitude of the s ecies.

By Cuttirtgr. The species which strike hy cuttings most readily are those
helon 'ng to the encra Plcea, Albies,11hrix,and Cedrue. The cuttings may
he en from elaterul branches, when the current year’s shoots arc
beginning to ripen, and prepared like those of (la heaths3 they should then
he planted iu saud, and covered with ag . his being erally done in
August or September, the cuttings should be kept in a e, from which
frost is exeluded, throughout the winter; and the greater part of them will
send up shoots the following May or June, and may be transplanted the suo-
ceeding autumn. In the Londou Horticultural Society's (iarden, where
Mr. (iarden, the superintendant of the arboretum, is angularly successfirl
in this mode of propagating the plne and lir tribe, the cuttings are generally
taken off from the points of the laterai shoots iu September; and, being

planted 'in shallow pots of sand, they are placed in the shady part of a
rame, without being covered hy bell-glasses, trll the following spring3 when

they are put into a very gentle morst beat-and begin growing ιιι April.
