sent ont by Bishop Compton (sse p. ld), discovered the tree in North
emensa, and sent home, in 1681, s plant of it ιο the bishop, whose gardener,
the celebrated Georgo London, planted it in the palace gardens at Fulbam.
In Rny's Haterio Flauiorum, ublished in lost, the liquidarnbaris mentioned
under the names ol Styrsa ll crida, Styrus A'ceris lolio, and §byrsa irhor vir·
gistum but Plnlrenet, Cates ‚end Beuhin, who were all nearly contem·

rary with Ray, call it by its dpanish name ol Liquidantbar. 'l'he S ish
istorien, tbe Abbi clavigiero, in his History φ’ Mesioo, gives ths lolffimg
account of this tree :— “ The Xochiocotaotl, commonly called Liquidumst,
istbe liquid storax of the Mexicans. lt is e great trec (not a shrub, as
Pluche, the author ol the Spectacle de la Nature, makes it)= its leaves are
similar ιο those of the le tres, indented white on one part, and darlr in
another, and disposed int rees. The lruit is thorn end round, but poly-
gonous, with the audace and οιιςίοοΙ yellow. The barl of the trae is in part
green, and ιιι part tawny. By rncrsron ιιι the trunls, they extract that pretioue
resin, called by thes niards liquidambsr‚ and the orl oi the same name,
whichisstill more o orons ond estimable. They also obtain liquidambar
lrom a decoction ol the branches; but it is inferior ιο that whrch distils
from the trunlr.” (Cadea’r Τταιιι. Clam, i. p. 33.) The abbe adds that Quilbra·
luchs, which, he sa s, was the second neme applied b the Mexicans to this
trec, significa “br axe;” e name which seems singu ly insp ropriate, ιι,
according ιο most writers, the wood is tender eud supple· ln lingland, the
tree has been generally included in collections stom the time ol its introduc-
ιιοιι ; and there ere, ιιι consequence, some very fine specimens where ιι bas
been planted in a sheltered situation, and in en alluvinl soil naar water. ln
Scotland, and the north of Germany‚ it is somewhat lenden and, north ol
Berlin, it never attains the siae even of a low tree.

and st considerable distantes, with blachish belta. As it is very light, and
