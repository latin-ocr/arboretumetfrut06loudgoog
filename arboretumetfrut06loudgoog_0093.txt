to thatof Pinus Lembertidno, which hae been found an long. The eones
which are chichest in pro ttionto their length are those ot' P. Pinea, Cedrua,
and Arauedriae that cf te latter being almost s herical. The largest oi all
the coner known ie that of P. macrocarpa, wbi is more than l st. in length,
and (tin. iu diameter; end which wei he about tlbs. ln some species of

in P. Strhbus, and in the whole of the species oi Abies, the scales are loose
end open, arrd of a leathery or ech texture, and may be very easily separated.
The seed ie readily extracted from theletter description of eones, hut with

whence the cadicle proceeds and turns downwards into the soil; while, soon
