Europe. The wood is much used sor wainscoting; having not only an
agreeable li ht brown appearance, but retaining its odour, according to
Kasthoser, dor centurias. The kernel ol the seed, in Dauphine, Villars
informs us, is eogerly sought aster by a species of crow (Cdrvus Geryo·
meamea In), which shows an almost incredihle degree ol skill in
breaking the hardest shells. In Switaerland, the seeds are used in some
places as food, and in others aa an article of luxury ς and the shell
being very hard, and requiring some time and skill to separate it from
the keruel, the doing so forms an amusement for young persons in the
long winter evenings3 who, Kastholer observes, show sd ree oi skill
in rt that might vie with that of the squirrel. ln some paces in the
Tyrol, the seeds are bruised, and an oil obtained from them hy expression.
So abundant is this oil in comparison with that produced b other seeds,
that, whilea ound of flas seed yields only ἢ oz, ΙΙΙ). odcembra seed

but, as the breaking ot the seeds requires a long time, it is generally dearer
than most other oils: it hasa ver eeable flavour when newly meda,
but ve soon becomes rancid. Tdes ells of the kernels, steeped inany
kind dlv spirits, yield a fine red colour. In Siberis, thev sceda of the
sembra are sometimes produced in immense quantitiesr but in other sea-
soua there is scarcely any crop. Iu abundant years, they form, according
to Gmelin‚ almost the-sole winter food oi the peasantry. 'l’he seeds, both
in Siberis and Switzerland, are employed medicinally3 and Gmelin relutes
astory ot* two osptains of vessels, who were suffering dreadlully srom the
seurvy, and whose crews had almost all died oi the same discsse, being
cured in a few days by eating abundantly of these seeds. ln Britain,
P. cestra can only be considered as an oruamental tree3 ond, though
we hold it to he scarcely possible ior a pine to be otherwise than ornamental
(ifit were lor so other reason than its being an evergreen), yet we cannot

hall the time of the trees at Whitton and at Kew, are above 40 lt high,
with trunks from Ι n. to lt in. in diameter. The tr'se at Whitton is on very
