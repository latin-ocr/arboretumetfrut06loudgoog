put into execution in 1708, by the planting of three acres with larohes alone
on Craigvinisn, above the wood which Dulte James planted on the same

The latter idea of Duke John was affected by the eucloun of a considerable
extent of ground for the planting of mixed wood at Dungheld aud of near
300 acres at Eleu, forming a total of ,065 acres. Of thoee he liuished the
