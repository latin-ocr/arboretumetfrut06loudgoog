Varietr'es. The extensive geographical range of this tree has given riseto
many varietiea, though we have seen but very lew that can be considered
truly distinct. ln the Nouveaa Du Homel, only one is mentioned; but
it is added, that, in the landes ol Bordeaux, in the sandy downs along
the aea coast, where the trees send down their taproots to a great depth,
some are to bs found which produce clusters os eones from 30 οι· 40 to 80,
or even 100, in acluster. This is stated by Loiseleur Deslongchamps, on
the authority ol Dr. There of Dax, who adds that this luxuriance ol vege-
tationis not constant; for the same trees which have borne so many eones

given to them in British gestiens, though hardly, as we think, meriting that
distinction. We shall, however, give all the varieties of which we have
seen plante, and leave the reader to judge for himself.

than those oi the species, but they are equally long end strong. The
eones ure shorter, and more ovate. This is the most distinct and
lrandsome variety of pinaster that we have seen: it was first intro-
duced into Britain by the Earl of Aberdeen, in 1825, the tree
having been pointed out to His Lordship in that year, by M. Riaso,
at Nice, as growing. thou h rather sparingly, in the mountains,
about la or 15 miles from theu city. From seeds brought to Eng-
land hy Lord Aberdeen, planta were raised3 and one presented by
him to Lord (irenville bore conss in 1836,and is now (1837)
l'llt. high: one presented to the London Horticultural Society,

aller being 8 years planted, is now llll. high, hut has not yet
borne eones.
