powerful inducement to the use of iron rods for supporting sundard rosea,
dablias, and similar planta, and it is very proper that suc rods should be
painted to give them durability; but there is less excuse for uployi
rron rods, or rods of joiner's worlr, for tying up small green-house planta, an
snrall plante in the o n border; and none,aa we think, forpainting either
wooden or iron rods o apes-green. The natural colour of the berk of young
trees ia, in our opinion, greatly preferable. lu the present dsy, when it ia ao
clearly proved that stalres and rods with the berk on can be rendered at least
of 6 or 7 years' duratiou by the lryanising process, we should always recommeud
their use in preference to iron. We aclcuowlcdge, however, the value of the
latter material for espalier ralla, some descriptione of trellis-work, raah-bars, &a

from §in to l in. Though a native of india, it appears nearly as hardy
as the European reed. Another species, in the same garden, B. erun·
