branched to the ground, aad growing in deep soil free from stagnatiug water,
concludes that there must be ‘¹ some constitutional tendency to corruption
ia the larch,” which is excited by a combination ol' circumstances3 and that
we must lirnit our knowledge, for the present, to the fact that certain soils,
perhaps slightly modified by other circumstances, produce sound, and others
unsound‚ larch. According to Mr. Munro and a writer in the Quarmty
Joanral ofd ‘ ere, the rot has even made its appearance in the mountain
plantationeo Dunkeld, in many situations, more especially in those which are
moret

Canker. It has been founder Athol und Dunkeld, that, when larch is
planted oa soil that has borne crops os corn, it cankera; and thiais the case,
also, when it is planted iu wethsituatious. Among the larch plantatione formed
since the commencement of the present century, Mr. Munro informs ue,a
malignant distemper has broken out, which resembles the cauker in epple
trees. “ First a branch gives way; theu a black liquid iesues from the point
of union with the trunk, the regular ascension of the sap seems to be impeded,
and the albumen is disposed in rather large uentities on each eide of the
affected , which gives the tree a very uusiglrtly and gibboue appearance.'’
(θανά. eg„ vol. ix. p. 553.) Any attempt to cure this disease by extemal
application, Mr. Muuro holds to be ineffectual; but be thinks it may be pre·
vented by using transplanted plante, and carefully planting them. This dis-
ease is not mentioned by arry other writer, unless tt be the blister mentioned
by the editor of the Quarterlgy Journal of Agricultura and in the editor’s letter
to Professor De Candolle ( Bibliotheque Univerrelle, February, 1835, p. lla), aa
“ another disease incidental to the larch, which threatens to involve larch plant-
atione in serious consequentes.’' (Quart. Journ. Aga, vol. v. ΑΜ.)

We have thought it better to give the mode ol culture practised on these
estates iu a connected relation, than to separate itinto fragments, aud place it
rander the different heads already given; because the practices etrrployed and
the results obtained, will in this manner be better understood, and more likely
to lead to useful deductione by the reader. John Duke ol Athol gave a short
notice of his plantatione to the commissionem of NavalRevision in May, 1807,
which was published iu the Genera! Report ofScotland,vol. ir. p. 4984 hut by

Grace’s truetees to the Highland Society of Scotland ς from which we hare
already quoted the history of the Athol and Dunkeld plantatione. The fol—
lowing abridged quotatione will describe the mode of culture pureued, aad

tice, he found that “elevated situations were better lor the larch than low
ones ; that declivities were better thau flats; that lsft. or ltst. was the best
distance at which larcb planta could be planted asunder; aad that they
should be planted in autumn, in preference to spring.” This, iu short, may be
considered the essence of the duke's experience. As introductory to the
observatione which are to follow, we canu t help noticing the great pleasure
which the duke seems to have taken in his dr erent plantatione3 some extracta
