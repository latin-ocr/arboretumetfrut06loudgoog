The barli of the Abietinae is thia ia young trees ; and, iu some species of
rste aud Plcea, eveo in old trees, it ia never either very thick, or voey
1rispiuph. In many 'es of Pinus, on the contrary, it becomes very thick,

cracked, and seply furrowed in old trees, from the tnsnks of which it
cnsp be cut in large platcs.

he wood is chiefly composed ofparallel libres, arranged in a manner
somewhat intermediate between that of dicotyledonoua aud monocotyle·
donous treas and, in consequence of these libres not being very close, the
wood is elastic and resilient. Beiu resinous, it is also, ιιι general, very
durable, aad of great combustibility. schaux remarks thet “ the branches of
resinous trees consist almost wholly of wood of which the organisationis

The leaves are, in almost every case, linear, subulate, acicular, aad per·
sistent; though in tunningbama they are lanceolata, and in demm ohlong.
In some species they remain on for four or live years, and, in Amscslssa,
for ten or twelve years. ln only one genus (Lirin) are they deciduous.
ln Pinus, Larix, aud Cedrus, they are placed topether in bundles of from
tto 6 in a bundle; hut in Abies and Plcea the eavea are single. Where
the leaves are in bundles, they are considered by botanists as abortiva
shoots; because the rudimenta of a shoot are found at the base of the
leaves: and hence, in pine planta of only one or two years' growth from the
seed, the leaves are solitary3 and it is only in the third or fourth year
thet in the axile of these solitary leaves small short shoots appear,
each terminating in a fasciculus ol from 2 ιο 6 leaves. The leaves of
all the speeies are without stipules3 the numerous scales which are
found among them when the shoots are newly developed, being considered
as belonging to the huda. ln Pinus, the leaves are in general more than
double the length of those of the other genem the shortestasin P. sylvestria,
being from lgm. to 2in. lon ς while those of P. Pinastcr are from 6in. to
9in. in length, and those of P. ausuilis Mela. are from lft. to l} ft. ln
all the other genera, tho leaves are not much longer than half an inch3 and
veryrarely, as in Plcea Wehbs'dss, exceed au inch. The long-lassad species
belong ιο warm climates; and these, when grown in cold elimatas, have their
leaves considerably shortened. lu texture, the leaves are hard and cori-

copposed of parallel fibras, like those ofthe Monocotyledhneae.

e huds are enclosed in numerous scales, and are developed in the axile of
the leaves, or at the extreme points of the shoots. In all the species they are

Abictioae on the other hand, there is not one hud for a milliou of leaves3
and the few that are found in the axils are almost confiued to the genera
Abies, Pfcea, ιιι-ιιι, and Cedros. The buda are most numerous in Lhrix,
and least so in Pinus, in which last genus they are almost entirely confined
ιο the points of the shoots. In general, the hud which terminatas the summit
of the trec, and is destined to form its leading shoot, arrd increase its height,
is develo ed the laat; and thia retardation seems a provision of nature for the
safety of the most important shoot which the tree can produce ς thus in·
