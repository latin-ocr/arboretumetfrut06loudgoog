and the timber will increase in valueas we asin bulk. The wood vades in
colourfroma yellowish white to a brownish red, the latter being produced
by the presence of resin. That wood which grows slowest,and in the coldest
cimete, is considered the best, and it is generally of the darkest colour.
That which grows with the greatest rapidityis commonly white, soft, and

resinous, wood isalmost exclusively of very slow growtb r it is hard, dry, aad
does not adhere ιο the saw; while the more rapidly grown wood, when iris
resinous, chokes tbe saw, and has aclammy unctnons leel. When rapid-grown
wood is without resin, it is white end spongy,· and tbe surface, aster tbe saw,
has a woolly aggpemance. Itis evident that such wood can neither bestrong

are many exceptione. Some of the Russian and Baltic pine timber is often
clammy, the saw raising up and pushing before it what the carpentem call
{trings3 while the pins timber of Norway and Riguis generally red arrd

The wood is valued, like that of every glires pine, in proportior to its liee-
ness from knots; and it is found that the knots of this species are much more
easily worked, and mnch less liable to drop out of flooring bonarda, than is the
case with knotty boards of the spruce or silver fir. 'l'he facility with which
the wood of the Scotch pine is worked occasions its employment in joinery
and house carpentry, almost ιο the exclusion of every other kind of timber,

The timber of the Scotch pine, when ithae grown rapidly, on a good soil,
and in a favourable climate, such as in most parts of the low country both of
England and Scotland, is found, when not of more than 2⁰ or 30 years
growth, toconsist chiefly of sap wood, and, hence, to be of very short duration
when employed in buildings, or for any other rural purpose. To render it
more durable, Mr. Menteath‚ of Closeburn, in Dumfriesshire, hus been in the

It would appear, either that the alkali of the lime neutralises‚ in some egree,
the albuminous matter of the eost wood; or that the water acts as a solvent,
and extracta a part of it; for, while Scotch pins of 20 or 30 years’ growth sel-
dom laets 30 years before it is destroyed by worma, timber of the same age,
which Mr. Menteath has steeped, has already lasted 40 years, and is as sound
as when first put up. The solution of lime water is formed bya very small
