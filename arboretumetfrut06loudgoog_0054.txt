The yew was formerly much relued in Britsrn, on account of the use made
of its wood for bows, this wcapou being tbat principsllp used by tbe ancient
Britons in sll their ware. lt was fernl to several Bntis kings3 rin, Harold,

The custom os lenting yew trees in churchysrds has nercrbeen satisfec-

that they were useful r tbe purpose of nflording shsde or shelter to those
who came too soon for the service. The subject bas occupied the attention
of vsrious writers; of whom the lest who bes talreu a comprehensive view of

“ Many reasons beve been assigned for the frequent occurrence of the yew in
