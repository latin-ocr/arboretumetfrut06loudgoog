from bin. to din. thick near the baae; ita rapid growth during the laet
iour yeara is, most likely, owing to the roota having penetrated into
a aubaoil more congenial to ite growth thau the soil in which it
was planted. Allowing the plant ιο be about 25 years old when
turned out, it may be considered aa being about 56 pcata old when it
llowered. lts site waa in the doner-guden, on a hor
