The mr is one os the dest Nurser for other trees, not only from its dense
mass o foliage, which map be considered ιιι rcservoir of beat, but because,
communicatorum its being abundanti furnished with brauchea on
the sursace oi the ground, it acts sa a non-concinctor, and keeps the soil from
cold and drought; and, while it rotecta the plantto be sheltcred from high

From the great abundasse of resin in the leaves an bark, the trec is conai-

braaches melts much saster than that which falls on any other tree, which
is another argument in its favour ιι a nurse plant. William Adara, Esq, ol
Blair, in Kinross-shire‚ aplauter oi great experience,gave the following opinion
as to the comparative merits of the larch, the spruce, and the silver fir, in
1794 :- “ The lsrch being ‹leciduous, is not ι good nurser and, from its quick
growth, itis probable that itis ι great robber oi the nourishrnent of other
trees. From my own experience, 1 have no hesitation in sayinp that the
