in 1696, givesa more detailed account. After ascending the mountain sor
four hours and e half, he carne to a small village called Eden, and in two
hours and a half more, to the cedars. “ These noble trees,'’ he says, “ grow
amongst the snow, near the highest part of libanusy and are remarkable, as

them in the Word of God. licre are some ve old, and of symigiom bulte

in the first edition of his flictiownry, art. cedrus, states that afrreud ο his, who
visited the trees in 1720, confirma this account, except that he found the
spread of the largest tree to be 22 yards in diameter, instead of 37 yards in cir·
cumference. La R ue, who visited the cedars in 1722, says that he counted
20 lar e cedars, edingen of which had a trunlr l9ft. in circumference,
and airead 120li. in circumference. (Voy, dre.) Dr. Pococlre, who visited
Syr-lain the years 1744 and 1745, has given us the following account of the
state in which he found these celebrated trees :—“ From the Convent of St.
Sergius (Latin Carmelitefriars), there is a gentle ascent, for about an bour, ιο
slarge plain between the highest parts of Mount Lebanon. Towards the
north-east corner of it are the famous cedere of Lebanon ε they form a grove
about a mile in circumference, which consiste of some large cedars that are
near to one another, a great number of young cedars, and sonte pinea. The

columns which seem to be composed of several pillars: higher up they '

body, aa described above, and of a triangular figure, measured ltft. on esch
