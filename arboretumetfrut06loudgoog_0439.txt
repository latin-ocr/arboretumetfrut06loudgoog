(Mache.) ⁴‘ By a strange mistake ο1 Linnoens, this species ie handed down
as a native ol Siberis, because Gmelin phi. Sih, v. i. 182). mentions a Thdjs,
to which he misapplies the synonymes o the present, but which, hy his own
account, is different; for he says it is paler than the garden ltind, and smaller
in all its parts. It was brought to him bys travelling snrgeon, from rocks
near Pelnn in China, and couldbeuo othert an Tlorientalisss’ (Santhin Rees’s

Europe in the time ο1 Francis l., at the beginning of the sixteenth century ;
Clusius having stated that the first tree that he saw ol it was one in the Royal
Garden at Fontainebleau, which had been sent lrom Csnads ss ι present to
that monarch. It was cultivated in England by Gerard, who observes, writing
in 1596, that, though not a native ο1 the country, it grew in bis garden ver
plentifnlly. As the tree ripens abundsnce ο1 seeds, rt is rendli-propagat ,
and, from thetime ο1 Gerard, has been one of our commoneat hardy evergreens.

Itis soher than the white pme‚ and gives a wealrer hold to nnils; l'or which
reason, the Canadians always join it with more solid wood. The elder Mi-
cbsux, in his journey to Hudson’s Bsy in 1792, found the church established
there by the Jesuits yet standing. This building, constructed in 1728, as

ln Britain, the American arbor vitoe can only be considered as sn orna-
mental sbrnb or low tres, thriving well in any soil, even in the most exposed
ntnations, but attaining its largest sire in low, sheltered‚ and moist places. It
bears the knile aud the ebears; and is frequently emplo ed to form hedges l'or
shelter in dens and nursery grounds. The smalllsr branches are long,
sleuder, an remarkably tough, and may he used as ties to laggotnvood, or
wsttles to lances, where stren h and durability are required. The tree is
