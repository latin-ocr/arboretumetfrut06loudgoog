runs to the next trec, which he also mouuts with suc expedition, that agood
workman will trim from 200 ιο 300 trees in a day. The season ior cutting
the pines is from May to September3 and the resinous matter flows most
l'reely iu warru westher3 it also llows much more irecly from those trees
,which are exposed to the sun, than from those which ow in the shade.
Resides the resin which flows from the wounds iven to etree, some drops
exude irom cracks in the hark, which dry, and lbrm grains, often employed
to adulterata the incense used in Catholic churches, hythe persons who
sell that substance. These nanual drops are only produced when the trecis
besum very old, and when nearly all the resin which it can he made co yield by
artificial means has been extracted irom it. The resinous matter which exudes
from the pinaster is called hy several names in Franee, everi in its rsw
state. That which incrusts on the sides ol the wound is called barras. lt
is nearly as white ns wax, and ia used to mix with that substance sor
making tepere, to which it gives suppleness and elasticity. The barras is
collected only once in the year, at the end ο1 the seas0n3 aud it is scraped
off with a kind ο1 iron rake. The principal substance which flows from
the trec is called galipot, or rc‘rine crolle. This substance, having been
collected in the hollow cut in the trec, or in the trough attached to it,
is put into large pits or reservoirs, capable of containing 150 or 200 har·
rels each, which pits are dug in the earth, and lined with planks made ο1
the pine trec, fitted so close together as to prevent the liquid oozing
through. lt is afterwards mclted in large copper caldrons, set in brick-
work, ιο free it from the impurities mixed with it. Itis necessary that
the caldrons used lor this pur ose should he set in hrickwork‚ witha
proper chimney to conrey away the smoke3 as, should the smoke he mffered
to come in contact with the resin, the whole would probably take lire. lt
is also necessary to keep continually stirring the resin, to prevent it from
hurningat the bottom of the caldron. When the resinous matteristo be
made into brown resin, some ol the barras is mixed with it; and, when the
mixture is thought to be sufficiently boiled, a little ο1 it is poured on a pisce
ol' wood; and if, when it becomes cold, it will crumble between the fingere,
the resin is ready. It is then poured through afilter made ο1 straw laid
horizontally, and din. or hin. thick, and run rnto barrels, where it is lest to

harden. ln this state it is brown and brittle, and is called by the French '

brai rec, which is the brown resin of the shops.

To make yellow resin, when the resinous matter is hoiling‚ a quantity ο1
cold water rs added, a few drops atatime: this makes the resin swell;
and a trough having been previously fixed to one side of the caldron,
the resinous matter flowa through it to a vessel placed to receive it. From
this thc operator raises it by a lacllelul at a time, and puts it back into the
caldron; repeating the operation several times, till the resin becomes as
yellow and as clear as wax. lt is theu filtered throuoh straw into mordds
hollowed in the sand, where it is formed into the calces sold in the shops.
To make these moulda, a circle is first traced in the saud, with a forked
stick, which acts like a pair os compasses ς thc sand is then hollowed out
with a knife, and the bottom and sides of the mould are well beaten with
wooden mallets tomnke them perlectly hard and smooth. The cukes ο1

it ran, and, in short, all the apparently waste materials used in preparing the
resin, are carefully preserved, and hurnt in a close fumare, in order to make
lamphlack3 or in a tar fornace, to extract from them a mancus matter, which
is sold cheap, and called in France potr noir, or hlack pitch.
