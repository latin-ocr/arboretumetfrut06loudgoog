studies from puzzling himself iu finding out specitic distinctions where none
really exist. The resson why ve wish to keep every variety and subvariety
as distinct ss possible is, that, in the practice ol arboriculture, whether lor
usesul or ornaments! purposes, a variety is osten of as much importauce aa n

ighlaud variety is known and acknowledged to pro uce timber of a superior
uality to the common kinds and, in point of ornament, sor situations where
he common kind of Scotch ine ia too large, the species may be repre·

P. sylvestris have short-pointed resinous bade, differing less in this respect
than they doin their cenes, or in the length of their foliage. P. Larlcio

P. lidda (which we consider tobethe centre ol a group of varieties generally
trested ss species, under the names of P. rigida, P. varilbilis, P. serdnua, dte.)
are very small and resinous, and they aremore numerous on the shoots than iu
any other species, either Europeau or American. All the kinds belonging to
P. ratde have also the peculiar property os sending out numerous small abor·
tive shoots frorn the dormant or adventitibus buda in their trunks and lerger
brauches, by which the trees may be known st a glance, even at a distance.
