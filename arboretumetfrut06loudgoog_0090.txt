Tus Abietinse, or the pine and 111 tribe (srbres verts, Fr. 3 nsdelbolz, Ger.)
are timber trees, 00 importent in the construction 01 11011000, and in 01111
architecture erslly, 00 the oak is in the construction 01 ships, and in 011
kinds 01110 srchitectrrre. The trees 01 this section 01 1110001111οτιο 01000
