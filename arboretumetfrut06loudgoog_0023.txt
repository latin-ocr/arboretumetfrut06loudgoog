“ The emperor Caligula found, near Velitris, arr extraordinary plane tree. It
bsd some of its branches formed like a roof, and others as scats. In this
moon the emperor gare asupper to listeen persons, which he called the Feest
of the Nest, because it hnd been giren in a tree (Quam emtam appellauit ille
sidem).” (Id.) Pliny also speaks of a tree in Arcadia, which, he says, was
planted by Agamemnon3 and he states thet cannes, and other vessels for the
sea, were formed of the escavsted trunks of the plane trce. Cicero mentions
the plane tree ss well calculated to afford a thick shade, by the extent of its
brancha, sud the thickness of its foliage.

'l'be chium, or (luentsl plane tree, has been cultivated in Persia frour the
earliest period; and Erelyn etates that “ a wortlryknigbt, who ataid at lspaban
when that famous city wss infected with a regi pestileuce, told” him “ that,
since they hare planted a greater number of ¹ihese ,noble trees about it, the
plague has not come nigh their dwellings.'' (Hunc, Erret, ii. p. 56.) Irr the
messuere des Eartc et Forc'tr, the same obseruation is attributed to the
Cherslier Oberdin, who was probably the “ wortby knight” alluded to by Ere·
lyn. This gentleman, who was also called Sir John Chsrdin, arrd who publisbed
a folio editron of his trevels, written in Frenclr, in London, irr 1666, observes of
the gardena of the Persiarrs, that they are nerally dirided iu the middle hyan
aveuue of chinar trees; and that, ss the ersiaus do not use their gardens for
wslking imbutas a place for sittinginsnd breathing tlre fresh air,the generally
sest themselves un er these trees. Str Robert Ker Porter found e Persian
gardens intersected by arenues of lane trees in different directions ς and
Morier, Colonel Johnson, and Sir illism Ousely, agree in attributing to
than thia characteristic, and in describing the Persians aspreferring the chinar
asa tree to worship under. Sir William Ousely mentions that orr these trees
the devotees sacrifice their old clothes by lrnuging thern to the branches3
aud that the trunks of favourite chinar trees are commonly found studded
with rusty nails and tetters3 the clothes sacrificed being lest nailed to the
tree till they drop to pisces of themselves.

Iu Frasers Helorion! arrd Descriptise Accourrt of Persia, publishcd in 1834,
when speaking of the general effect of the scenery in Persis, the author says:
‘⁸ No trees glsdden the lendscapc, except the tall poplar, or the stutely chrnar
(Plftanus orientdlis)‚ which rise abore the horels of the persuum or the fruit
trees of their orchards3 or, perhaps, a few of other sorta which may hare been
planted on the m 'n of s wetercourse‚ to supply the little timber required :
and these, dottinaiiie wide plain with their dark oliage, courcy to the mind

'l'he Orientnl plene tree appears to here been introduced into Englaud about
the middle nithe sixteenth century3 as⁴Turner says, irr his Herboll (the first
part of which was published under the title of the Names cf Herber, as esrly
ss 1541, though the entire work was not finished till 1568): ‘¹ 1 have scene

the Oriental plane growing nglarrd; but he tells us that his “servent,
Willism Mnrshsll, whom be sent into the Mediterranean Sea, assurgens urrto
the Hercules of London, found divers trees hereos growing in Lepauto, hard
by the sea side, at the entrance into the towne, a port of Mores, being pert
of Graecet sud from thence brought one of these rough butkens, being the

thia p e, that Mr. Trsdescarrt bad then (1663) trees of this plane growing
