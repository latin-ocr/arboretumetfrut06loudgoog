A borch Hedge, which inicedietdly became o Fenee, was formed, in the spring
of 1831, to enclore a four-ecre field of high, dry, end rather poor land, rn the
following manner: - A ditch was duglft. wide, in the directton of the fenest

The expense of digging the ditch snd planting did not exceed ls. per Scotch fell
(18 tt. hin.) ; and thus an effective live fonce was put up, st less then would
have erected a 3-reiled pnling, the decsy of which would commence the dry
