thus proring that its church stood where druid worship had been performed.

can we, then, longer doubt the real ori ‘ of planting yew trees in our church-
yards? If it be said that this usual, thmugh not natural, situation of the yew
tree proves the veumable specimens which we tind in churchyards not to he
older than the introduction of Christianity, it may be replied, that our earliest
Christian churches were generally erected on the site ol'a heatheu tem le,
and that at least one motive for placing churches in such situations woul be
their proximity to trees already sacred, venerable for siae, and indispensable
in theu rel' 'ons ritcs. That these ritcs were performed, and altars erected,
in grossa, rom the remotest antiquity, we know from the Pentateuch. 'l’he
devotione and sacrifices of Baal among the Moabites, and the idolatrons rites
of the Canuanites and other tribes of Gentiles, were performed in grores and
