that on a mnened, low, moist meadow, on this bne of rosd, was sn

in bis journe to Hudson's Bay, it is only beyond the St. Leuconoe, parti-
cularly near iuste St. John, and the Great and the Little Lake hfisatassin,
tlist it 'ns to abouud, and to form messes oi wood, some of which are

latitude. New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the coldest and loomiest expo-
sures in the mountaiuous tracte ol Virginis, are the limits oi its appearance
towards the south ς but it is rare in these statest and, iu Lower Jersey and
the vicinity oi New Yorit, it is seen only in the swamps af white cedar

trees are more worthy ol cultivation. It was from this tree that Solsnder

first described L. a. pendula ss adistinct species, L. a. ritbra not havin

been introduced till 1760. The original tree ol this latter variety was planted
by John Dulce of Argyll at Whitton, where Sir James Edwsrd Suuth and
hir. lambert saw it early in the present century, and where we examined
it on the 2lat of July, teat, end found it between 4011. and 50 st. high. The
