'l'he modern history ol the cedar of Lebanon is attended with much greater
certainty. lt may be said to commence with the revival of literature,
as almost· every modern traveller who has visited Syria has ascended
Mount Lebanon, aad recorded his visit. One of the first travellers who has
dih ttltfflllt: li llttltllthlltt lltylt'tltylllt:
considerable height up the mountain, the traveller arrives at the Monaster of
the Virgin Mary, which is situated in avalley. Thence, roceeding (hur
miles farsher up the mountain, he vill arrrve at the cedars ς e hiaromtes or
tbe monks retinges ides. The cedars stand in avalley, and not on the top
oi the meantdn ; an they are supposed to amount to 28 in number, though rt
indifficult ιο count them, they beinp distem lront each othere t'ew paces.
Thesethe Archbisho ofDamascus aa endeavoured toprove tobethesame

and it is generally so ccv with snow, as ιο be only accessible in summer.”
(Dc Aah, dcc, p. 4.) About this period, paying avisit ιο the cadara ol' Mount
Lehanm metus ιο have been considered aa a kind ol' pilgriuaget and, as every
visitertoolawa someolthewoodoithetrees,tomaltecrosses andtaheruacles,
the patriarch od the Maronites, fsaring that the troes would be destroyed,
threatened excommunication to all those who should injure the cedars ς and,
at the same time, exhorted all Christiana to preserve trees so celebrated in
Holy Writ. The Maronites were only allowed to cut even the branches of

these trees oncea aar3 und that was, on the eve of the Transfiguration ol
our Seviourt which festival occure in Au st, and consequently at a suitable
period lorvisiting the mountain. On this estivel, the Maronites and pilgrimo
repaired ιο Mount Lebsnon, and, passing the night iu the wood, regaled
themselves on wine made from grapee grown on the mountain, and lighted their
lires with branchos cut from the cedere. The passed the n' tin dancinga

kind of rrhic dance,and in singing and r g; and the ollowing day the
festivalo the Transfiguration was held on the mountain, and the patriarch
celebrated high mass on sn altar built under orte of the largest and oldest
cedars. (Bel. in Arb. Gom, ὄιος and hainin N. Da Ham, v. p. ³0⁰.) Dr.
llunter, rn bis notes to Evelyn’s Sylva, sa s,-“ we are informed, from the
Memoirr qsthe Meriones-irs irs tlte Levant, that, upon the day of the Transfigu-
ration, the patriarch of the Maronites (Christiane inhahitin Mount Libanus),
attended by a number ol' bishops, priests, and mocks, aod ollowed by five or
stertisset-‘stitutus lli} ‘ild' tt ‘lffl'ltldlffi
told that the patriarch officiates ntifically on this solemn occasion ς that his
followere are particularly mindsu of the Blessed Virgin on this day, because
the scripture compares her to the cedars of Lebanoo; and that the mme
holyiatherthreatensvith ecclesiastical censure thosewho presume to hart or di·
minish the cedsrsstill remaining.” (Hunter's Eoelgrn ii. p 5.) La lhoque,in his
VoyagedeSyn'eetduMont Libon,in1722,mentionsthis ete3andaddst-“The
Maronites say that the snovs no sooner begin to fall, than these cedsrs, whose
bought are now all so equal in extent that they ap to have been ahorn,
