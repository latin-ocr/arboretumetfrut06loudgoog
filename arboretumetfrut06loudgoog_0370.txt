forming all 'nda of plantatione, suggested to the duke many improvementa
in the mode of planting trees in general, and particularly that ol the larch,
and the treatment of that wood during the progress os itsgrowth. The result
of that experience has introduced a sint le, cheap, and efficacioris mode of
inserting larch plante into the ground. it has also determined the proper
ageos the plant at which it should be planted, so aa it ma acquire the
greatest state of erfection atthe earliest possible period. lt iias indicated
the proper numier of planta to be employed in planting an acre, both
in low and high situations. lt has proved, beyond disputa, the capability of
the larch not only to vegetare, but to thrive luxuriantly, in elevatione far
beyond what were previously rescribed for its locality; and it has shown
that larch timber may be ‘u 'ciously employed in the construction os the
largest class of vessels. The late duke carried on all his plana in planting
systematically‚ which enabled him to detect any improvement on every new
trial. Every new trial did, in fact, discover some improvement on the former, till
the very last plantation which he executed gave him greater satisfaction in
the worlr than all the preceding. Seeing the advantages of enclosing the
ound before planting it, as practised by his litther, in preserving the woods
ffers the depredatione of men and animala, he enclosed every piece of ground
substantially with ahigb stone wall, dry built, for which there was abundauce
of excellent materiale on the spot, before it was planted. Seeing, also, the
disadvantages ofallowing the wrld shrubs to interfere with the growth of treas

These shrubs never grew to a troublesome height at an elevation exceeding

heath attains to the height of npwards of 2 st. Feeling, too, the inconve-
nience of being shut out from viewing the interior of a plantation, he caused
reads to be formed in every convenient direction through the grounds which
were to be planted. These roads were not metaled, but they were made
quite accesstble to wheelcarriages, by the fillin up of hollows, and the

which were always planted with apruoe instead of larch, as being a tree more
suited to that particular state of t e ground.
