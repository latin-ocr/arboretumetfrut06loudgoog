Propertier and Uter. The wood of the cedrus Deoddra possessas, as we
have before observed (p. 2429), all the qualities attributed by the ancients to
that of 0. Libani. lt rs very compact and resinous, and has a fine, fragrant,
refreshing smell, lilre' that felt when walking in plne graves towards evening, or·
in meist westherr and very different from thatof the cedar of Lebanon. Its
wood has a remarkably fine close grain, capableof receivinga very high polish ς
so much so, indoed, that a table formed of the section of a trnnlr nearly 4ft.
in diameter, sent by Dr. Wallich to Mr. Lambert, has been compared to a
alab of brown agate. DnRoyle informs us that the wood is particularly
vdned for its durability, and is much used in the construction of Himalayan
houset. In Cashmere, secordi to Mr. Moorcroll (Lonrh Pha, ii. p. 94.),
it is nsed for buildings, both nb ic and private, and for bridges and boats.

etnrpentine from this trae, Dr. Royle informs ns, is very llnid,and,

though costae, is much valned in Upper India for medical purposes; the .

leaves and twigs are also used by the natives in medicine ς and tar and pitch
are procured from the trunlr.

ln England, the specimens of it are at resent small; bnt the feathary
lightness of its spreading branches, and elle beautiful glaucone hne of its
leaves, render it, even when young, one of the most ornamental of the coni-
ferons trees; and all the travellera who have seen it fnll grown agree that it
nnites an extraordinary degree of majesty and grandenr with its beauty. The
tree thrives in every part of Great Britain where it has been tried, even as far
north ss Aberdeen3 where, as in many other places, it is found hardier than
the cedar of Lebnnou. It is readily propagated by seeds, which preserve their .
vitality when imported in the eones, bnt scarcely otherwise. lt also grows
freely by cuttings, which ap ear to make as handsome free-growing plants as
thoseraieed from seed. lt has been inarched on the larch; bnt the latter tree
being decidnona, it may be donbthrl whether plaute so propagated will atisin
a large siae, and be of great duration. lt has been grafted in the wedge
manner on the common cedar, in considerable numbers, by Mr. Barrow, gar-
dener to the Earl of Harrington, at Elvaston Castle. Mr. Barrow has given
a detailed account of his process, and of the success which attended it in
Gord. Mag, rol. xinp. 80. The nnrsery cultrue, and the soil and situa-
tion in which it is to be finally planted, may be considered in all respecta thc
nme as those of the common cedar.
