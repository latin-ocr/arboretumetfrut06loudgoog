bruises the reads very much, many of which are, of course, destroyed. We
have several times made uae os the improved barli mill, for separating the
seeds from larch eones3 but the conss are thus so much compressedand

soil, and ιο aa to rice about the same thickness as the Scotch pina, that is,
at abouta quanter of aa inch distant from each other. Mr. Sang recom-
mends sowing the larch on ground from which a crop of two years old seed·
ling Scotch pines has been removed. No preparation of the soil, he says,
can equal that of the roots of seedling Scotch pines; and the next best pre-
paration is a crop of two years’ seedling larch. In either case, the seedhnga
