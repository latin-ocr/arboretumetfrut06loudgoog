citron wood. lt is, he says, much more solid and strong than the ordin
white woods of Europe; and, though the trae ir closely allied tu the con ·
ferre, it has nothing resinous in its nature. lu China and lapan, the salis-
buria appears to be grown chiefly for its fruit, the uuts of which, as Dr. Abel
observes, are very generally ex forsale in the markets of Chiua3 though
he was not able ιο aetertum w ether they were used aa food, or as medicine.
lu lapan, according to Kampfer, they are never omitted at entertaiuments3
enteringintu the composition of several dishea, aster having been froed from
their austerity by roasting or boiling. They are reputed, he says, to ba usel'ul
in digestion, and in dispelliug flatulence. Thunberg says that even the
lleehy art of the fruitio eatan iu lapan, though iusipid or bitterish3 and
that,' slightl roeated, skin and all, it is not unpalatable. Some of the fruit
which ri n in the Botanic (iarden of Montpelier were tested by hl. Delille
aud erBondous of Turris, who found their flavour very like that of
newly roasted maiae. M. Delille says that, aller roasting the num, he found
nothing in the kernels but a fariuaoeous matter, without the least appear-
auce of oil; notwithstanding what Kaempfer incidentally mentions ιο the

fertilisiug the fruit. ln Europe, hitherto, the use of tha trec has chiefly
been as a botanical ornameut; but it is suggested by Loiseleur Deslong·
champs aud others that, as it mewa with great rapidity in the south of
France, it may be planted as a timber tree, and applied to the same uses aa

in the neighbourhood of Londou, thrwee beat on a deep sandy loam, per-
lectly dry at bottom; but it by no means prospers in a eiuratiou where the
subsoil is wet. Were this not the case at Purser'a Crosa, tha trees there
would, doubtless, hare been much largar thau they are; aa, though oue of them
is tha ' hest in En land, yet the head is not so ample, nor tbe trimlr ao

The situation should be sheltered‚ but not ao muchan as formany exotio
trees, which have longer leaves, and mora widely spreadiug branches; such
as tba Magndlio acumiudta, the Ontario poplar, and the Plitantu occi-
denthlia. ln Scotlund, the salisburia is considered rather teuder, andis
planted aginat a wall. It is propagated by layera, of two-years-old wood,
which generally require two years to be properl rootad; but, on tlte Con·
tinent, it has been found that, by watering the layers freely during the aum-
mer, they may ba talen off in the autumn ol the year iu which they were
made. Cuttings made in March, of one-yearold wood, slipped off with a
heel, root in a mixnue of loam and eat earth iu the ahade; and their
growth will be the more certain if they have a little bottotu heat. cuttings
of tbe young wood, taken off before midsummer,and prepared aud planted
with the leaves on, in saud, underabell-glass, will, we have uo doubt, suc·
seed perfectly. In Frauce, boiseleur Deslongchampa informs us that, in some
soils aud situations, cuttings grow with such rapidity, that in three or
four years they form plants 6ft. or 7 lt. high. (Amen, dte, tom. xv. p. 96.)
