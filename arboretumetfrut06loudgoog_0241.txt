All m'epegr of the southern states is made from the dead wood of P.
enmblis, consisting of trees prostrated by time, or by the lires annually
ltindled in theforests3 of the summits of those that are felled for timber3
and of limbs broken off by the ice that sometimes overloeds the trees.
(See p. 2137.) It has been already observed (p. eloe), that, as soon as
vegetation censes in ιιιγ of a plne tree, its consistence changes: the
sap wood decays, and the eart wood becomes surchapped with· resinous p'price,
to such adegree ss to double rte werght [ιι a year3 an that tlns accumu tion
increases for several years. Dead wood is thus productivc of tar for several
years after it has fallen from the tree.
