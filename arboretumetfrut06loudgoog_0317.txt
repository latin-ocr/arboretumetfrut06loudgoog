about the nronth ol* August, the Italian peasants who live near the Alps
make a journey into the mountains to collect the torpentine. They carry ιιι
their hands cornere of tin, terminating in a sharp point, and a bottle ο1 the
same metal suspended to the girdle round their waists. Some ose bullocks’

Aa soon as a cornet is filled with the cleur torpentine which flows lrom the
tumoor,or blister, οιι the tree, it is emptied into the tin bottle, which is carried
suspended from the waisr; and, when this bottle is hill, its contente are
comoed into a large leathern bottle, or goatslrin. The straining is to l'rce the
torpentine from the leaves, and bits ol' berk and mosa, which may have fallen
