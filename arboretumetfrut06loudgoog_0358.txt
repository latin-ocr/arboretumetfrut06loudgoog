Raith, at Leslie, and at other places in Fifesbire, the larch had, in isra,
attained agrest size on rich baulrs and in warm situations; but, in nearlp
1000 trees which were cut down at that time, there was scarcely one in whie

the trunlc was not beginning to decay at the beart. (Ibid, p. 59.) The fimess
ο1 soil t'or larch, Matthew observes, “ aens to depcnd chiefly upon the abi-
lity the soil possessas ο1 affording an equeble supply ο1 moisture; tltat ia,
upon its mechanical division, or on its powers of absorption or retention ol'
rnoisture; and its cbemical composition would seem only efficaciom as oon-
dueive to this.'' Throughout scotland, he says, wherever he has observed
the deca ο1 larcb wood, it hes resulted almost solely froin unsuitableness ο1

(Isin, p. 18.) “The larch,” Sir W. Jardine observes, “is very soon lost

classes r the first, where lareh will acquire a sine ο1 from 30 ιο 300 solid feet,
and will generally be found free ο1 τοις the second, where it reaches only
from 6 ιο 20 solid feet, and, in most cases, becomes tainted with rot before it rs
80 years old. As this subjectis ο1 great importance ιο the planter of the
lsrch, and as Mr. Mattbew is an author whose scienee and practical knowledge
msy be relied on, we quote his observatione on the subject at length :-
