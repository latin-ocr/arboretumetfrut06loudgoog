Turpeutine is rarely mede from tbe pinaster, ss itis very inferior to that
produced ιγ tbe silves fir. Oil ol' turpentine is, however, procured ιγ
distilling the galipot, or saw resin, obtained lrom the tree, with water.
Tbe cil meends wrth the water, from which itis afterwards se arated3 and
the residue is the colophony, or blaclr resin, of the shops. be tar pro-
duoed hom the pinaster, which is very inferior ιο that o the Scotcb pine,
is called in France, goudron des Laudes, or goudron de Gaze. When the
trees bave yielded all their resin, they are cut down, and the thiekest parts of

In Britain, it can hardly be considered edvisable to plsnt the pinaster for
its timber, in eny situation where the Scotch pine or the larch will grow3
and, esen isit were profitable to employ the tree in the production ol resin,
our summere are probably not sufficiently warrn to roduee that secretion in
any quantity. Aa an ornamenta} pine, the pinaster holds tho first rank ; and
