Aberdeen, where more plants of the Scotch pine and lereh are, we hahere,

Hence, when the head of such a tree rs left to itself, a smaller or greater
number of years will elapse before a leading shoot, or one or two leading
shoots, are produced; aad till thetis the case, and the sap, in consequenceis
diverted into main channels, instead of being equally distributed ovar the sur·
fece of the bush, no vigorous rowth can take plere. ln like manner, the
matted roote of a plant which has been a long ,time kept in a pot, when they
are not spread out m mausplanting, will be some years before they throw out
leading or main roots, without which the art of the tree under ground eeu
no more grew vigorously, then the part a ve ground can gron vigorously

his spreading out of the roots is more espe-

without main branchos. The pro er time for transplanting the abietinas is,

when the plaute ara of any size, care must be taken to perform the operation
