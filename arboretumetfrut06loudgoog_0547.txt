The number of inhabitants in a colony varies from 100 to 20ος and, hence,
the more numerous the colony, ιιι more fre tl is a change of residente
required. These webs consist of agreat num erothhresds, notunlikeapider
wahs, arranged aomewhat irregularly‚ hut sufficiently loose to enable the in· '
habitante to be seen through the covering. The caterpillars eat only the
arench aof the upper side of the leaf3 they also arrange their threads
lamtuffiy, each, apparently, having ι thread of ita own, along¹ which
it moves either backwards οι forwerda without disturbi its neighboura,
which, when in re se, are arranged side by side. The urget-sized nesta
include several of t e smaller branches or twigs with their leaves ; and some
idm are of afirmer texture than the rest, parently for resisting the vet.
hen the pareucbyrna of ιιι upper sides ο ιιι leaves enclosed ιιι the weh
has been conmmed, the nest is abandoned, and a new one made, enclosing
a fresh bunch of twigs, each of the caterpillars spianing a considerable number
of threads; and thus each colony constnrcts as man as 6 οι· 8 distinct webs,
diahgrring the trae, especially when, ss is osten ιιι ιιιι, Ιιιιι·ι ιιι many
sociaties established upon it. The leaves, thus half-consumed, wither up, aa
well as the young· branchos, for want of support, and ιιι ιιιι assumes the
ιιι tristatam ιιιιιιι
ιιιΙιι eir escape by spinmng a long thread, aad dropprng to the ground.
When touched, alw, they writhe about with great activity, and will run
baclswards nearly as fast aa forwards.
“When full grown, about the beginning of Jul , each caterpillnr encloses
itacll' in a long and nearly cylindrical cocoon of wllite silli (fig. atat. d), of

a leothery consistence; and these cocoons are arranged side by side at one

end of the nest, formin amasa not unlike, only considerably larger than,

a mass osants’ egga, as ιιι ιοιοοιι of the ant are commonly called. Aa the

whole of a colony has been reared from one brood of egga, ιι is generally the

case that the entire number commence the constmction of their cocoons at

the same time, and ιιι whole are generally completed in the same day. In

this cocoon, the insect immediatelp undergpes its change ιο ιιι chrysalis
ιο

state (fig. atet. c); andita chrys is, wh does not materially differ hom
those of other small lepidopterous insecta, is of a shining cheatnut colour.
lt differs, however, from the chr salides of the leaf-rollers, in wanti the
transverse series of hoolrs with which the abdominal egmrcenta of the tter
chrysalides are furnished; and hence, when, at ιιι expiration of about 20
days, the perfect insact is ready ιο corne forth, being unable ιο work the
chrysslis out of the cocoon, the escape of the imago is effected within the
latter, aud the moth, with ita wings in an unexpanded state, makes its wa
out of one end of the cocoon, aster which its wings soon spread to their ful
siae.

“ 'l’he perfect insect is shown at ein fig. 2464, with its wings expanded,
and m rhed} s is the same, with its wings closed, and of the natural size;
and g, t e caterpillar, rather magnilied. - J. Ο, W!
