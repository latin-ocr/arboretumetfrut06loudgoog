exudes, accordinglto some, during the night, from the bak of the young

shoots; but whic , according to others, transpires froin the buds and leaves,
on which it coagulatos in the form of little white glutimus grains, which are
easily scraped off. ln the morning, young larch trees, before they are atnick

gethered, will soon disappeac. very cold winda prevent the formation of
this substance, which is called arenae de Btienpou, because it is found in most
abundance in that country. lt resemblee the manna of the llowering aab

rof this trec, aa we bave already observed, by Dr. Anderson, in 1777, when
the oldest larch trees in Scotland could not have been above 5⁰ years old,
and, doubtless, none of them had been cut down3 aa the earliest notice of
one of the Athol larchea having beenfelled isin that year. (See Appio Ges.
Rep. ipsene, vol. iv. p. 493.) Dr. Andersou's sources of information, thera·

been already puoted. The first British author who treats of the velue of
the woodoft elarch etl th, and from hrs own experience, isPontey;
who, in his Fet-est eum, t e first edition of which was publishedin 1805,
states that the larch excels foreign fir in all the following respecta: -
