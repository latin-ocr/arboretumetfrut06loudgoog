Demiyrtion, dc. 'l'he American candleberry myrtle is a evergreen
shrub, growing ιο the height of la lb and upwards, in favourabe situations,
and forming a thick bush. lts general appearance and habita closely resemble
those of the Europaeo species; the leaves are, however, larger, and more
serrated; they are evergreen, and, instantium, greatly resemble those
of the aweet hay. 'l'he male cathina are axillary and sessile3 hut bevenot
the shining scalea of the Myrice Gdlc. The fruita are globosa drupea, ahorn
the bigneea of a grain os bbct peppcr; covered with an unctuoua substance
as white aa anow, which gives them the appearance ol' alrind of sugas plum.

lina3 and the varieties, in New En land and Penusylvania: tbe species, and

A kind ol candleberry myrtlais ound in Canada; but it appears to belong
to Myrice Gdle, and not to M. censere. The principal,if not the only, uae
made of the candleberry myrtle, in Ameriae, is the collecting from it of its
resinous wax. Thia substance, according ιο Dupleasy‚ was formerly procured
by gethering the berriea carelully with the stall attached, and hoihng them
tall they burst, when the oily matter the contained rose ιο the surlace; it was
then skirnmed off, and set aeide to har en, till it became asubstanceof about
the consistente of putty, and of a greenish oolour, which waa easily blanched,
and was readily inflanrmable when made into candles. A better way is said
ιο be, pouring boiling water on the berries, by which means a purer wax is
extracted, ofapale ellow oolour. The candleber wax is so brittle, thata
piece will break it' het fall: it may also be reduce? to powder, like common
resin. It becomes, however, solt, like common wax, by pressure. When
made into candles, it is necessary to mix it with bees’ wax, or a little anet.
The water in which the berries were boiled or inhssed is used to give a greater
degree of lirmneas to tallow candlea. (Vdgttouae Redmu, ii. p. 60.) Gulti-
uvated trees are said to yield more wax than those that are found vnld. The
candles formed ol this wax burn long, and 'eld a grateful smell (Smith’s Con.
assitha„ and they ere said to have the athlantsge of producing an agreeable
aromatic fra ce when they are blown out, or otherwise estin iahed. Ac-
cording to m, aaoap ia made t‘rom the wax, and it is u by surgeons

is accounted aspecific in the toothach. T is shrub has been cultivated in
English ahrubberies since 16993 and there are planta of it at the Duke ol
Deyonahire's villa at Chiswiclr, and at various other places in the neighbour-
hood of London, from dli. to Β lb. high. ln Franco and Germany, it has been
cultivated with a view to its producing ως and itis said to thrive in sandy
peut, rather molat, andto produce an abundant crop of berriea every year. ln
nucia, it has been cultivated in a den on thebanis of the Spree, near
Berlin, in lat. 52⁰ 53‘ ς which is nearlflp degree farther north than London,
but where the mean annual tempereture is 2ο 9‘ higher than London; and
'wax and candles bave been made lrom the fruit. It hasbeen suggestel
by Dr. Hamilton (Gara. Mag, vol. i. p. 403), that it might be cultivated for
thetppmplpurpppde in high sandy vastes in Harnpahire, and other parts in the
sou o ng .
