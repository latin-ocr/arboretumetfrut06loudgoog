Description. A tree, in North America,120lt. high. Trunk very thick,
osten from aest. to lost. in circumlereuce ιι the base. anchlets very
slender, elegantly pinnate, berla brownish. Leaves pectinate and distichous;
s reading horizontally, from being twisted ιι the base; linear, mucronulate,
tiss, l·nerved (nerse aomewhst depressed above); glabrous on both sides,
lightgreen; margins acute, exterior aomewhat conver, ἢ in. or more in length,
about l line broad. Male catkins roundish, in a racemose penicle3 scales
very short, obtuse, concave, keeled, membranaceos· on the margin. Galbulus
roundish or rouudishoval, of the siae os a pigeou's egg. The trae, though
yramidal in form when it is young, yet, when hill-grown, has a reading
road head, somewhat in the manner os that os an old cedar ol banon.
There are but few trees in Britain which have assumed this character; but,
according Micheas, it is common in the swamps ol America3 and it has also ,
begua ιο show itself in some ol the old trees ιι Whitton and Syon. The

wood, also, is whiter‚ less resinous, and less heary. These are called white
cypresses. The others, ol which the bark is browner, and the wood beavier,
more resinous, and of a duslrier hue, are called black cypresses3 whence we
bave, in some catalogues, T.d. nigrum butthis name we have not given in our
list of varieties, as it is obviously only that ol a variation. The wood is fine-
grmnad, aad, alter being for some time exposed ιο the light, becomes oss reddish
colom: it possesses great strength and slasticity, and is lighter and less re·
sinous than that of the pines. lthas alaoa greater wer oi resisting heat
and molsture.¹ The foliage is open, light, and ol* a lres reesble tint; each
hond, or young shoot, is 4 in. οι 5in. ong, and consiste o two parallel rows
os leaves upon acommon stem. The leaves are small, fine,and somewhst
arched, with the conver side outwarda. ln the autumn, they change from a
light green to a dull red, aud soon alter fall off. The deciduous cypress blos-
soms iu carolina about the lst of February. The male catltins ιιι produced
in flexible pendulous amente, and the female in very small hunches. The
coues are about as large as the point oi the thumb, hard, roundirh, and of an
uueven surlace. The seeds are small, ligneous, and ol' irregular shapes, with
scylindrical hemel: they are ripe in October, and retain their productiva
power two years. (Lomh, Mtclr.,and obs)

The deciduous cypress, in Americaattains its largest sine in the swamps of
the southern states and the Floridss,on the deep miry soil ol which a new layer
is every year deposited by the floods. Thesetrees,which are sometimes 40 ft.

ι in circumference ιι the base, are, however, always at least three ιίιιιιι ss thick

there as they are in any other art os the trunk. The base is usually hollow lor
three quartem os its bullr; and¹ its surface is longitudinally surrowed with deep
tortuous channels. ln consequence oi the hollowness and comparative worth·
leasness of the lower part oi the trunln the negroes raise themselves on scaf-
folds δὴ. οι 6 lt. from the ground, when the trees are to be felled, in order to
cut off only the sound part os the trae. The roots os large trees, particularly in
situations subject to inundation, are charged with conical protuberauces, com·
monlyfrom lft. 6in. to fist. hi h,and sometimes from ist. ιο d st. in thickness:
they are always hollow, smooth on the sursnce, nnd covered with areddish harh,
like the roots, which they resemble also in the sostness os their wood. Michaux
says that ‘⁸ no cause can be assigned for their existence: they are peculiar to the
deciduous cypreseand begin to appear when it is onpp 20ft. or 25 ft. high. They
are made use of by the negroes or beehivesJ' e adds that they exhibit
