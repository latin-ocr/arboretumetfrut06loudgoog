and the great dillhrcnce between thathee in these lentations, and in its'
native habitata, in hilly or mountainous scencry. ven the differente be-
tween the tree standing alone or in small groups, and growing in extensive
plantatione, is so great, that it can hardly be recogniaed by a general observet
to be the same species of tree. In close plantatione, whtch have never been
thinued, the trees assume, after a certain number of years, a gloomy mmenesa
of appearance; and, where these are planted in belta, aa they often are, along

so much less strong and durable than Highland or foreign wood of the same
kind, is another cause of the ttae having got into bad repnte, though the

'l'he great contempt in which the Scotch lit is commonly held, says
Gilpin, “ ansas, 1 believe, from two estrees. People object, first, to its colunt:

m es little distinction int ismatter. lt bas no attachment to one colour
in preference to another, bnt considers the beanty of all colouring as result·
ing, not from the coloars themselves, but almost entirely from the harmony
with other colours in their neighbourhood. So that, aa the lir tree is snp-
ported, combined, or stationed, it forms a beautiful umbrage, or a mnrky s ot.
A second source of that contempt in which the Scotch fsr is commonly held
is, our rerely seeing it in a picturesque state. Scotch lira are seldom planted

from this hondage, they are already ruined. Their laterai brauches are ne,
and their steens are drawn into poles, ou which their heads appear stu as

had been presentedz its stem would have taken an ensyswcep, andita
lateral branches, which naturally grow with almost as much beauttlitl irr -
larity as those of deciduous trees, would have hung looscly and negligqnllh
and the more so, as there is something peculinrly light and feathery tn tts

state, would possess these beauties3 bnt it would at least have tha chance
of other trees; and 1 have seen it, though, indeed, but rarely, in such a
state as to equal in beanty the most elegant stone pine. All trees, indeed,
crowded together, naturally risa in perpendicnlar stems; but the fir has
this peculias disadvantage, that its laterai branches, once injured, never
shoot again. A grove of crowded sapliags, elme, bacchas, or almost auy
deciduous trees, when thinued, will t row out new laterai branches, and
in time, recover a state of beattty; but, if the education of the lir bas been

neglected, he is lost for ever.” (For. Secta, i. p. 91.)
