to Theophrastus, it was dedicated to Plator because the tree, when ont down,
never throws up euclem and hence also, erhaps‚ the cnstom mentioned hy
Horace, of shutting up in the tomh with the dead a branch of cypress, and
enveloping the body in its fronde ; though some suppose it to have originated
in the supposition that the balsamia odour os the cypress would neutralise the
infectione exhalatione proceeding from the corpse. Among the Romans,
manyauthors mention this tree. Plin tells several extraordinary storles

Romans made verdant walls of cypress in their gardens3 and also that they
clipped the entire trees into a variety of forms, so as to represent a chusan
fleet uf ships, and numerous other fancies. He adds that, in his time, there
were standing at Rome some cypressea that were more ancient than the city
itself. Plato had his code of lawa en avedon cypress wood,asbeing more
durable thau hrass. Vitruvius and hdrartial also speak of the great dura·
hility aud beauty of cypress timber. Columella mentions the various rural
uses of the cypreas wood; and Cato (Dr Re Rustico) gives directions l'or
making plantatrons of cypress trees, recommending the plantem to procura
the seed from Tarentum. The odour of the cypress was thought ao halaamic,
that the Eastern ph icians used to send those of their patients who had weak
lunga to the lale o Crete. ,ln the middle ages, we find this tree fr uentl
mentioued. Leon Alberti,a celebrated Florentino architect of the fi teenth
century, tells us that he found the wood of uveasel vvhich had heen submerged

doors of St. Peter at Rome, which had lasted from the time ofhonsrantine

from the belief that it would never decay. The Turlrs plaut cypresa trees in
their cemeteries, one at each end of the grave, when they inter their dead ; and
these are so numerous at Scutari, that the cemetery there (seefig. 2323.) re-
sembles one vast forest of cypress. This magnificent buryingground extends
