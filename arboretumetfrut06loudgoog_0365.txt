taking good heed that no cart-wheel, in passing, or feet of large quadruped,
wound the bared roots. ln exposed situations, tlte earth may be gradually
removed from the roote.

‘⁴ The rot in larch taking place in the part appropriate to knees, the forester
cannot be too wary in selectiug the situations where there is no rislsof its
attach, sor planting those destined for this purpose. It is also desirable,if
possible, to have the knee timber in ground free of stones or gravel, as the

up tn the wood, particularly in those places between the spurs where the saw
section has to divide them sor lrnees. Were the roots caresully bared at an
early period, it would tend to prevent the gravel from becoming etnbedded
in the halb. Nothing can be more annoying to the shipwright, when he has
bestowed his money, ingenuity, and labour, upon an unwieldy root, and
brought his ltnees into figure at the eost of the destruction of his tools by
the euveloped gravei, to iscover stains of incipient rot, which render tlte
intended lrnee mere lumbar.

“As the larch, unlilse the oali, affords few orno croolrs naturally, excepting
lrnees, tlte artificial formation of larch croolrs is of the utmost consequence to
tbe interest of the holders of lsrch lanmtions now growin. ln order to
· obtain a good market for their straigit timber, it is absolutely necessary to
have a supply of croolts ready as soon as possible to work the straight
up. 'run would increase the demand, and then enhance the price of the
straight more than any one not belonging to the crast could believe. ln good
soil many of the croo swonld he of sufficient siae in 20 years to begin the
supply, if properly thinned out. In a forest of larch, containing many thou·
ssnd loads, and which had been untouched by any builder, we have seen the
greatest difficulty in rocuring crooks for one small brig. lt is only on very
steep ground, and wlfere the tree has been a little upset after planting, that
any good crooks are found. From the rather greater diameter required of
larch timbers, and also from the nature of the fibra of the wood, we should

Felting. Tha larch is a remarkahly easy tree to fell, from having no large
boughs to interfere with the adjoining trees. The best season for performing
the operation is winter, and the trunk may either he severed from the root,
or otherwise, accordin to the object in view. If the pound among the re·
maining trees is to be iept as grass, root-falling is obviously to he preferredr
as will generally he the case when the roote are of any· velue as luel. In
order to season the wood of the lorch, as we have already seen, p. 2365, Mr.
Monteath recommends barking the trees standing, and leaving them in that
state for one, or even two, summere, before they are cut down. A number
of larch trees on Dounipace estate, in Stirlingshire, were barked by Mr.
Monteath, and stood in the peeled state two summere, before they were cut
up, and the wood made into paneled doors; which stood erfectly without
war-ping or twisting. He has since frequently himself used: and seen used
by others, the timber of larch trees, alter having stood twelve months with
the berk talen off, then cut down, and immediately cut up into bettane for
flooring; and also mado into paneled doors and window frames, for the better
sort of houses, with equal success. (Forert. Guide, ed. 2., p. 240.) It hasbeen
remathad, that the roots of the larch, when lert in the round, decay much
sooner than those of the Scotch pine; the former being liable to the attacks
of an insect which cloes not prey upon the latter.

leaves being deciduous, it is liable to l'ew accidente, either from wind or
