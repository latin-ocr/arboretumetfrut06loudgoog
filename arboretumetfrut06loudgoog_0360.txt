¹‘lhe lightness of larch, especially when newly cut (about one tint lesa
weight than the etergreen Con lerae), gives afacillty to the loadi and
carriagc, which enhances its value, independently of its greater strengt and
durability. These larches in which rot has commenced are fully as suitable
for paling as the sound: they have fewer circlos of sap wood, and more of
red or matnrcdwood. When the rot hes commenced, the maturing or red-
dening ol the circles does not proceed regularly, reaching nearest the berk on
the side where the rot has adranced ferthest'’ (Itu, p. 88.)

found that, though the eones of the larch are et their full siae ln autumn, yet
the greatest art of the seeds they contain are not then arrived near their
maturity, and that they ripen herging on the trees, during even the ooldest
winter months. He therefore defers gethering the eones till the mouth of
March or Δ ril, when they easily part from the tree, and many of them drop
from it. tle sccds, when kept in the conas, will retain their vitality for four

Gandolle attaches no great importance to the choice of seeds3 though it
cannot be denied, he says, that trees growing from seeds taken from discased
trees must be more llable to those same diseeses. lic cautione such as

The eones gethercd m the Vallais, he says, are generally opened by the heat
of the sun, or over a slow lire; and the seeds from that quarter are preferred
by the cultivators of France and Germany. Coaes ripened in Britain may
either be dricd on the kiln, without previous preparation, in the manner
already directed for the Abietinae in cneral (sce p. 2131.); or each cone
may be split before patting it into the ln, which is a safer method, and less
likely to injure the sceds. 'l'he operation of splitting, Mr. Son informans,

best and least destructive to the seeds ofany methods we know ; because the
eones so split, when exposed to the heat, are suddenly opened, and readily
