notioed this tree. We were once inclined ιο conjecture that it might be the
Abies orieuthlis ol Tournefort, notwithstanding the discrepmcy between the
description aud the Cephalonisn plantr but, having examined the specimen ol
Abies orienthlis in Mr. Lambert’s herbarium, we are satislied that the latter
isavarietyof the commousprucehr. The merit ol' introducingA.cephaldnica
into Englend entirely belongs ιο General Napier, who, from his work, The
Colonia, and also from ι pamphlet bv him, entitled, Memos'r on the Βοιώ gf
Ceprlralons'a, seems to possess au enthusiastic attachment to the island, and ιι
ardent desire sor its improvement. He was articrrlsrly anxious that this forest
ridge should be enclosed ιο ns to exclude e gustu¹ and to allow the trees ιο
grow up and become timber; and, when he was governor, made many remon-
strsnces on the subject ιο Sir Fredericlt Adam, the chief commissiones, but
without effect. ln 1824, in com liauce with ι nequest of Henry t. hung,
Esq, ol Ham ton Lodge, sustinebamus was desirous ol lmowing the

soeds were without the οοοιι, and were sentto the careof the colonel’s sister,
Isdy Bunbury. The pseket was dul forwarded to Hamptou Lodge; but
some seeds havingdropped from it, lady Bunbury gave these mds to Chsrles
Hoare, Esq, o uscombe. Mr. Richard Saunders, the woodreere at Lus·

Threeol' the plants raised-were given to Mr. Piuce ol the Exeter Nursery,
and one ιο Μι. Pontey ol the Plymouth Nursery. The other four plenta are
remaining at Luscombe, dourishmg exceediugly well, and never having had
any protection during the winter, since they were lanted iu the open air. The
