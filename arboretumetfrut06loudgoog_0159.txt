As s timber trec, for pleuting in poor dry soils, end in exposed situations, ,

noue can excel the Scotch pme, and it is only equalled by the larch.. ln
Britain, it surpasses every other species ol the pine and lir tribe for shelter-
ing other trees, with the exce tion ol' the spruce lir, which, being of a more
conical sbape, admits more light und air to the heads of the trees which are
tu be drawn up by it. The Scotch pine is, however, altogether unfit ior giving
shelter in single rows, unless the branches are allowed to remain on, from the

und upwards, sud the roots have sree scope on every side. Hence, this pins,
ilii everwother species oi the tribe, is altogether unfit ior a hedgerow tree.
When planted in nerrow' belts round ficlds lor shelter, it soon becomes un·
rightly, unless tlte trees stand so thin as to allow of their being clothed with
branchos l'rom the ground upwards. The true situation lor this trec, when
grown for timber, is in massas over extensive surl'uces.
