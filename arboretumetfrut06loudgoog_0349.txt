Paye de Vaud, uae augere nearly an inch in diameter, with which they pierce
the full-grown larchea in different places, beginning at 3ft. or 4st. from the
ground, aad mounting gradually to lOfi. or 12 ft. They choose, generally,
the routh aide of the tree, and, where practicahle, the knota formed hy
branchee which have been broken or cut off, and through which the turpen-
tineis seen exudin naturally. The holea are alwa a made in a elanting
direction, in order that tha turpentine may flow out opthem more freely3 and
care ra always taken notto penetrate to the centre of the tree. Το rheae
holee are fixed guttere made of larch wood, which are ¹d in. wide, and from
ldin. to coin. long. One of the ends of each gutter terminares in a peg,
thro h the centra of which ie hored a hole about llio. in diameter. Tlns

led into a small bucket,or trough, which receives the turpentine. ln the coun-

The wdod of a tree from which the reain hae been extraetcd is never used
for building purposea: it ie, indeed, only good to bum; and the charcoal
made from it ie very much lighter than, and very inferior in every respect to,
that made from larchec which have not been deprived of their resin. The
turpentine of the larch ia called Venice turpentine, because it used formerly
