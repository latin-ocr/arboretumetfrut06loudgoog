As ornamental objectarent of the speeies ol the Abietinre are eminently
deserving of culture, aud they may all be said to be beautiful in every stage
of their gontb, from the regularity and symmetry ol their forms, from
their foliage being evergreen, aud hom the lolly stature soeained by most of
the spetiei when hill grown. The resinous odom ol most ol the species is
also a powerliil recommendation to many ons in modern timu, as it was
andeirtl to the Greeks and Romans. The ce oi the common spruce lir

Among e most ornamental species are, the cedar oi lebanon, the codar
of Deodar, the silver lir, the murdris mineris, and tlre Pinea Webbidnat
bnt all the species are ornamental in an eminent degree, when full grown, as
single objecta. No species is more icturcsque than even the common Scotch
pirre, when it has stood detached‚ mnrned a considerable age, and has
gron in a niitable soil and situation. Some oi the commoneat species, in
particular localities, and honi accidente] circumstances, beoonie very singular
objects; such astbes ruce fir when its branchea take root at tbeir extremties,
and send up shoots witich become trees 3 or when, from being tbrovrn down
on its side, its branches become trees, proceeding from the parent trunk. ·
'llis sanie species also affords a curious monstrosity (ruisi excelsa Clsnbra·
olidas), which, when propagated, becomesa bush, seldom seen above ilfa or
aa. high. The silver tir and the cedar oi Lebanon, and also the larcb, osten
form brancby bearis, which, froin such beads rarely occurring in needle·
leaved trees, liare a very sin rulai· up aranee.

the aad hence do not require a deep sorl; and, as tbeir needlelike
leaves do not carry off much moisture by cvffiomtion, the soil in which the
Abietiure will grow to a large sine may be rier than tbstrequiredfor any

other kind ol tree. In pino and fir lorests, or extensive graves, the leaves
and decaying frondi of t etroes drop on the suriace ol tbs ground, and not
