in Britain about the end 011110 17111 centur 1 and about the middle 01 that
following, some planted trees, more especi ly in scotland, having been cut
down, and employed 00 11011101, were found to he 01 10101101 quality to imparted
timber, or to that grown in 11010101 foresta. Dr· Wallrer, wmting near the
eud of the last century, observes that the Scotch pine had been planted every
where in 1101000010 had not yet had time for its timber to 01111001 per-
fection. The timber 0111111 1100, 1100110010 depreciated, because it is white,
soli, and perishable3 though he argues that this is merely 110111 want of age
111 11101100. 10 1110 000100 01 years, 110 0010, 11110 white wood vn'll 11000010
red3 and the planted 111 will become more and more valuable in quality, and
be held in greater estimation. The preJudice against the woodof the Scotch
100 000010 10 have been st its greatest height between 1790 and 13103 for

arahel, waiting in 1790, 0010, the Scotch pine “should be invariably ex·
cluded 11001 every soil and situation in which any other timber 11000011 be
made to flourish. The north aspect 01 1110011 and barren heighte is the only
situation in which it ought 10 110 1010101011 and even there the 101011 is seen
to outbravfe it. ln better soils, and milder sinuatione, the wood of the Scotch
fir 10 worth little; andita growth is so licentioris, as to overrun every thing
which gram iu ita immediate neighbourhood; and this rendere it wholly un-
lit to be associated with other timber trees; we therefore now discard it
, entirely 11001 011 0001111 1001011000.” (Plorat. und 11111. 0111.,1. p. 146.) Soon

nearly the 001110 effect, from thesaure writer ; and the same 10010 have been
lately (1837) confirmed to us by Μ1.Ι)01100’0 son and successor, the present
Thomas Davies, Esq, of Portway House, 11001 Warminster. Pontey, in his
Forert Prnoer, published in 1805, 0100 defends the Scotch pine against the
“ 0110001 universally prevaleut” prejudices against it. “ At first sight,'' he
11111101010111111111111011111111111111111
prevailed, 1000111011 0 00111011 ago, against foreign fir timber; namely, apre-
y'udice, the 011001 ofinexperience. At that time, 00 workman could be found

of young trees aa timber; the absdrdrty 01 which, heasys, where strength and
durability 010 required, every one will admit.
