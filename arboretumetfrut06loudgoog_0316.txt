The woodwas employed by the ancients for many different pprposes. Pliny

ppseaks of a silver fir that formed the mest of avessel ou board which the

mperor Caligula had au obelisk trans orted from Egypt to Rome. This
mest required the outstretched arms four men to encircle it, and cost
subeo sesterces, or about 301. The Romans em loyed the silver frr for jave-
lins, as appears by the following lines from virgii: -

The resinous products of the sssver fir were also well known to Theo restus

The silvhr fir washntroducsd intoE land in the serenteenth century;
hut the precise period is not known. lot and Ray mention some trees
growin near Newport in Shropabire; and Evelyn speaks of two Spauish or
silver growing ιιι Harelield Parlr, Middlesex, that were planted there in
1003, at two years’ growth from the seed. The trec was stro ly recom-
mcnded by Evelyn for its beauty, aud its fituess to adorn walls an avenuesy
end it has, accordingly, been very generally lanted for ornaments] purposee.
ln 1197, the Society of Arta ave their golli) medul to Henry Vemon, Esq..
of Hilton Park, near wolverhampton, for having planted upwards of 6000
silver firs. As this tree ripens seeds freely, it is now common in the numeriae,
and very generally introduced into plantatione, especially such as are urna·
mental; and, in grounds laid out before the middle of the ei hteenth century,
it may seen near mansions, rearing its fine pyramidalb above all other
trees.

Propcrderosd Usee. The wood of the silver fir is classic, and thecolour
is whitish. The grain is irregular, as the fibres which compose it are partly
white and tendet, and artly yellow, or lawa-coloured, and hard. The narrower
the white lines are, the more beautiful and solid is the grain os the wood.
lu the Vosges, it ia said that the externel layers are more compsct than the
internal ones 3 which may an'se from the practice of barkiug the trees there
before they are cut down. The weiht of this wood varies exceedingly,
according to the age of the tree, the pi
of the truulr from which it was taken. According to Hartig, the wood of a
