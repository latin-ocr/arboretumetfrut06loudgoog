in the woodo at Woburn, His Grace’a 10100101, Mr. lrelaud, informs na that
ldr. 80110011, by cutting 1111 large branchos rather carried the practice too far;
bnt that the trees pruned under the direction of Mr. Pontey, about the years
1802 and 1803, were not in the sl' htest degree indured, as onl a few of the
010011011101101100 were taken off. n examining t e timber such trees as
were cut down, lllr. lrelund found the places where the branches had been
cut off quite anund, with new wood formed orer them3 but this new wood,
tho h closely corering the art cut off, yet did not incorporate 110011 with it.
