“ The comparatioeiy superior 11011100]Ι Larci to 0011 perdere has already been
alluded to, when the comparative quantities of timber per acre were made out,
by a statement in favour of the larch. In comparison to Scotch pine, asa
comparison 01 one kind of fir with another, the difference is still morestriltiag.
Fifty larch and 50 Scotch pine trees were cut out of the same plantation.
The average contents of the fir were 8 cubic feet, at 11. 311. per foot, or 101.
per tree. The larch averaged 30 cubic feet each, and fetched 20. od per foot,
or 31. 151. per tree. So that the larch was superior in contenta 3} times, aad
in value more than 7 times, to the Scotch pine.
