qug'apThe European larch, and also the Russian variet ,when old,or when
tbe trunlt is beginning to decay, will produce the Boletus laricis, whichis called
by some authors Agiricus pungens, and which is used in Russia, and some
other parts of the north of Europe, as an emetic in intenuittent severs. Itis
also the agaric of the larch of the shops. The body of tbis fungus is sapona-
ceous ; and, Pallas informans, isused by the women in some parts of Siberis
to wash themselves and their linen. 'l'he Tungouses dye the hair of their
reindeer with it and the roots of Galium verum, of a deep red colour. For

The Itotp in Larch Wood is a disease which has hitherto baffled every attempt
of physiologists and planters to ascertain its cause. It seems to have been
first observed about the beginning of the present century, when some larch
{erraterrat srlrstssrsrrinr tritt. latr
ca Counhy Retidencet, published in 1806. ln Sang's Paneas Kalendar, tlte
first edition of which was ublished in 1812, several instaures are given of
the rot having appeared in Jliifeshire, apparently from the trees having been
planted in too rich a soil, and too warin a situation. Pontey does not notice
the rot in larclr, though he does that of timber trees in general; but Matthew
treats of it at some length. ln the Gardener'r Magaaine, the subject is dis·
cussed by Mr. (lorrie and Mr. Munro; and there are several articles on the ’
subject in the Quarterly Joumat of Agricultare3 one of which, written in an·
swer to certain questions put by the editor of that journal to Professor De
Candolle of Geneva, we have already quoted from. From all these sources,
and some other incidentsl ones, we are only able to give tlre following un-
satisfactory account:— .-

The rot attacks trees at various ages, and in different soils and situations.
There are instances, in Scotland, of larch trees of 8 or 10 years' growth having
the interior of their stema tainted with the rot ; but, in general, both in Eng-
land and Scotland, it does not attack the trees till they are from 20 to 30
years of age. lt generally commences at the root, ancl proceeds upwards,
rotting the beart of the trunlt3 but, in some instantes, it has been foundto
commence at the top of the tree, and proeeed downwards. In a majority of
cases, Matthew observes, the rot commences in the roots which have struck
down despest into tbe earth, especially those immediately under the trunk
ol' the tree. Thence, the corruption proceeds upwards in the centre of the
trunlr ; which, when much diseased, swells considerably for a lew feet above
the ground ς evidently, ΜΓ. Matthew observes, from the new layers ofsap wood
forming thicker there, to afford necessary space for the fluid to pass upwards

and downwards; the matured wood, throu hwhich there is no circulation,
’ approaching, at the lower part of the trunlt, to within one or two annual
layers of the barli. The discsse can· scarcely be detected by the external

been subject to the disease for some years, the centre is so entirely rotten as
tohave become hollow, like a pipe or wooden pump; and hence, aa before
observed, the name of pumping has been applied to this disease. Sections of
trees, of different ages and siaes, affected in this manner, have been sent to us
by Mr. Gorneand Mr. Munro. ( Sec (ἰατά. Mag, vol. ix. p. 551.; and vol. x.
