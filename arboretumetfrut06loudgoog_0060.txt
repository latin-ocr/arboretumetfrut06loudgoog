The Arlington, or Harlington, Yew stands in the churchyard of the vill
olthst nenne, between Brentsord and Hounslow. It is chiefly remarkabe
l'or its large sine, and for having once been clipped into the regular lornr shown
in . 1986. This engrsving is copied from a print ol the tree, ns it appeared
in ovember, 1729, and this print is sccom snied byn cop οιι verses by
“ Post. John Saxy,” from which it appears that it must at time have
been between 50ft. and 60 st. in height. It was surrouoded at· the bottonr
os its trunk by a wooden scat, above which, et 10 st. from the ground, wass
