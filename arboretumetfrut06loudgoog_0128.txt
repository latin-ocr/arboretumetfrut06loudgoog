I‘ps ferruginea is another coleoptcroua insect, of small sire and depressed
body, which is found beueatb the barlr of the fir.

Tlle esternal Feeders conciet, for tbe most part, of the caterpillars of various
species of lepido terous insecta, together with those of a few of the saw-llies.
Amongst the fplringidoe is to be noticed the Sphlns pindstri of Idnnaeus,s
fine, but in tlus country very rare, s ecies, the caterpillar of which feeds
upon Abte excelsa, aud on Pinus sylvestris, P. Strbbns, &o This cater-
pdlar is smooth, and at first entirely yellow; but it finally becomes of s
fine green, witha brown dorsel line. The upper side of the bodyis terminated
by ι curved, blech, and homy tail. The perfect insect is of an ashy colour;
the fore wiugs being marked with three short, longitudinal, blaclr lines. lt is
nearly 34 in. in expansion of the wings. Bouchd (Gartea Ina, p. 63.) etates
that it is sometimes very destructive, when it abourms to a considerable
extent, occasionslly entirely stripping³ the Weymouth ine of its leaves.

Amongst the Iinnaean Bombyces, hermaphiiso ,on the Continent,
a erfect land scourge, entirely stripping many of the pines, especially the

eymouth, of their leaves. This large moth is of agreyisb colour, with an

spots on the sides. The moth and caterpillar are beautifnlly figured by Curtis
(agit. Eut, pl. 7.), who observes, in his new edition, that the henr with
which the latter are clotbed cause excessive imitation when hsndled. The
ceterpillars were found ιι the end of June3 and the moths appeared at the end
ofthe following mouth. Rossmiissler gives old trees of Pinus sylvestris ιι the
habitat of this species. The irritating powers ofthis insectare, however,
far surpassedb the celebrated pityocampe of the ιιιίιιιι, which is regarded
ιι the ceter illst ofthe Bombyx Pit ocimpa Febr. (genus Cnethochmpa

the processionary moth, before described. ( p. 1820.) The moth is of a
gre h colour, with tbree darker transverse bars3 and the caterpillars are
dar or duslry grey, witha white latersl line. They are processionary in
their movements‚ but not so regularly ao as the Cnetboclmpa processiones.
