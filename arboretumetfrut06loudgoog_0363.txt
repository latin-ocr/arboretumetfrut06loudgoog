lovring observatione :-

“ The lsrch nrsy be pruned with advantage at the time it sheds its leaves.
As it naturally advances in s fine figure, pruning is unnecessary until it attains
a height of from l0 st. to tlt . The strongest of the laterai branches should
then be regularly lopped off, about eft. from the stem, with a pruning knise or
bill. ln two years aller, these should be removed close to the stem, and
those farthestadranced in siae among the upper branches should besbortened
as above described, it not being sale to allow those rnost vigorous to be at
once cut off closeb the trunlr. In dtis manner the tiers shouldbe gone over
every two ears. he healthiest larches produce cones sparingl . Nothing
marks the dtus rogressos growth more thansgreat cro of seed ς and when
once the growtb is impeded by such, theltree commonly continues to yielrl
abundantly. In such cases, pruning rs particularly advantsgeous. In exposed

lsces the tree should not be wholly cleared os hrancbes to a certain height.
1l‘he wealtest should be allowed to remsin, which serves to keep the trec inore
steady in rongh westher” (Highland Soc. lictu, xii. p. 162). Mr. (lorrie,

tlte next brought down irum 10⁰ to 6⁰, or lower, according to the sice of the

the same ob'ects, has been recommended by Billington, ourselves, and various
others. Bi lington recommends tying the trees to one another, or to stokes
