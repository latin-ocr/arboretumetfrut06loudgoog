Tun prices of trees and shrubs vary permanently in different countries from
permanent causes, sud also locelly and temporally, iu every particular country, from
difficulty or l'scility ol cultivation, or from scarcity or abundance. The prices in Lon·
don, llollwyller, and NewYorlr, as given in the body of this work, ester ench of the prin·
cipal species described in it, will convey asufficiently accurate idea ol' the comparative
prrces os ligneous plante in both hemis heres. Nevsrtheless, we have thought it ad-
visable ιο publish the following five haalogucs, as well ιο show the variation iu
prices in different parts οἳ Europe, as to exhibit alist ol names os species and
varieties which existed in the year less in British and Continental nurserres.

How far the lants to which these names ares plied in the numeri-,are identical
with those to which the area lied in this A dum, it is impossible for us, in
many cases,to say. Ther 'er ceu only uncertain this by examining the living
plante, and conr aring them with our descnptions and figures. The ter number
osthenamesinthese (latalogues,however,are,we thinlr,correct; thou ,intbeoeseol
some ol' the genera, such es thatoelgrs, Quercus, Pinus, &c., this is not likely to be
· the case with all ol the species; sud in other genere, such as salix, Rbsa, Cytisus,
Genlsta, Spicea Olstus, Heliantbemum, dcc, it cannot be expected that the nursery·
meu’s names should be correct, since scarcel any two botanistsare agreed respecting
them: noris correctness in the names of ali the species and varietres of some ol
these genera of much cons uence in a practical point of view, provided the more
strikiu kinds ars known sn pro agated. Agreat improvement ruthe nomenclatore
ol hardy irnits has been made in hatich nurseries, by reference to the collection in
the Horticultunal Society's (iarden ; and especiall by country nurserymen obtaining
graba from the mmm the names adopt in the Society’s Fruit Catalogue
attached. till lately, same attention was not paid to ornamental trees and shrubs
that hes, ever since the Society possessed a garden, been paid to fruit trees; but
n reformation in this department is now going forwerd, and, rf London nurserymen
were to compare their plants and names with the names and planta in the Horticul-
tural Society's (iarden, they might be enabled to render their catalogues of them as

erfect, and their plaats as true to their names, es is now the cese with their cata·
ioguesand planta os fruit trees. Countr nurserymen generall¹come to London

once a year, and, by bringing specimeus ο their trees and shruhs with them, they
might ascertain the correct names by comparing th with the living plants in the

Chiswiclr (iarden. As cuttings l‘pvrsspropagation, or to be used as botanical speci·
