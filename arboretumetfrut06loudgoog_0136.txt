be increamd in number, if the colour ol the dovera and of the eones were
talren into consideration.

To observe the different forms assumed by the same species, they should
be atudied in all their native habitatu and, to mark how all these different
forms return to that of the species which may be considered the central or
normal form, it is neces ιο study them under cultivation in tha same soil,
situation, and climate. yspecres of Abietinae that are very distimt in

stevcr we may think on the subject ol species, we have treated all

the kinds in such a manner, and given so many synonymes, that those who

differ from us in opinion will find no difficulty in recognising in our peges dre

'es of other authors. The great objecta that we have had in mesaia

t is worlc, in reducing the number ol species, have been ιο simplify and to

generalise, in order to render the subject ol technical distinctions less per-
plexing to ersl readers, and to young studente in arboriculture.

Description. Evergreen trees, generali ol large aize, natives of Europe,
Asia, and America, and in an eminent degree both useful and ornamental.
They flower, in Britru'n, in May and June, and generally ripen their eones in
tha autumn of the following year. The species may be arranged either
accordingto their conas, or their leaves; and we have adopted the latter
feature as the foundation of our sections, because it is applicable to trees in
every stage of their growth; and because many ol the species in London
gardens have not yet borne cones.
