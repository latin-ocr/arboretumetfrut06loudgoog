by .Whitlnw of Dublin, about 1817, οι before, growing on the
demesne of the Risho 01 Kildare, near Glasnevin; but it appears
to have been negl till 1833, when Miss Blaclcwood discovered
a tree of it in Clontarf churchyard, near Dublin, blr. Mackey,
on lookin forthis tree in 1837, found no tree in the churchyard,
but severd in the grounds of Clontarf Castle; aud one, a large oue,
with its branchos overhanging the church ard wall, from which he
sent us specimens. The trec does not differ, either in its ahape
or foliage, front the common yew; but, when covered with tta
bertier, it forms a very beautiful object, especially when contrasted
with yew trees covered with berries of the usual eoral colour.

Other Vmietr'er may be selected from bada of seedlinga3 and it appears

that ahiud with shorter and broader leaves than usual was formerly pro·

pagated in the nurscries. The ew trec, in some situations, isfound with
spreeding branches, not unlilre tione of a very old spruce fir, and having the

spray drooping; but whether thia isa true variety, or onlya uariatior, rs un-
