Descriptionslc. Low evergreen shrubs, with the habit ol m trees;
nativesol' North and South America. InBritishgardeus,mosto the species

are somewhat tender. They preler a dry and deep sandy soil, or a eandy
loam ; and they are readily propagated by suckers, which are thrown up by
the routs, or by side shoots, which are occasionally produced on the stem.
They sometimes ripen seeds, whicb,il sowa immediately efter they are
gethered, and placed on atmoderate hot-bed, will come up in six weelrs. ln
their native countries, their leaves, treated like the stallrs os hemp or ilex,
afford a libre which may be used like that ol' those planta, in the manufacture
os clotb or cordage3 and the stema, macerated in water, deponit a feculent
matter, l'rom which starch may be procured. ln a floricultural point of view,
all tbe species are highly ornamental; and no lawn or flower border ought to
be without some of them. considered with reference to lundscapegardening,
the yucca, like other trees aud shnrbs of formal shapes and rigid habit, when
planted in messes, cannot reedily be made to barmoniae with the messes uur-
rounding it ς but, ae a single object, it is well adopted for attracting attention
on a lanu, for the summit of a formal knoll, for growing out of rockwork,
for ruins, and l'or various purposes of a similar nature. As the yucca grovn
naturally on the sea shore, it is particularly adapted lor marine gardana. In
