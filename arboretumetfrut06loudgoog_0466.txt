“The c ress,” he says, “loves the despect, most gloomy, inaccessible, and
inundat swsmps ς and seems to llourish where water covers its roots more

negroes surround the 1100 in periogues‚ and thus get at the tree above the
large end broad buttoclr, and lell it with comparative ease. They eut 011 the
straight shall as suits their purpose, and lloat it to s rsit, or the nearest high
