and many practical once too, run counter to the practice of thia planting, as

plantation, t egressis not worth od. more per acre than it was before it was

s ruce affords excellent ehelter to cattle, either from the heat of summer or

ecold of winter. Under ash, the velue may be 2s. or 3r. per acre more
than it was in its natural state; but under laceb, where the ground was not
worth lr. peracre, the pasture is worth srom 8⁸. to lor. per acre, aller the first
30 years, when ull the thinnings have been eompleted, and the trees left for
naval purposes, at tlre rete of about too to the aere, and 12 st. apart.”

Thiuniug. ‘⁸ The great object of the lete dulae seems to have been to raiae
larch timber on his property fit lor naval purposes. With that view, he
planted his trees, aad thinned his plantatione. No demand for wood sor mere
country purposes would have warrauted him to plant so extensively es he did.
He found that larches could grow to agreat siae at only 120. apart; aad this
distance gives 380 trees to the Scotch acre, which is little more than one fifth
part ol the 2000 per acre originally planted. The first thinning should bea
slight one, of about one fisth of the whole, by removing only those trees that
are ol least valae, or worthless. After 21 years from the time of planting, the
leaves fall off the lower beauches, which are, ol course, no longer uselul to the
soil below. From 20 to 30 years old, the thinniug is carried on so exten-
sively as to remove two thuds ol those trees which were left standing by
the first thinning. ln thinning, it is necessary to observe that all the strongest
aad healthiest trees should bc lest, even il two or three ol' them should be
closer together than 120. These small elumpe happening to light on a
favourable situation, they will thrive well, as the alr has access to each trec,
around two thirds of its circrrmserence. This thinning being delayed so long,
the trees thinned out will be valuable for a variety ol urposes. One of these
purposes is the profitable use which may be made ol' the barli. The lest thin-
ning should be given when the trees are srom 30 to 3⁵ years old, which will
leave from 380 to 400 trees per acre. The 380 will require a little pruning
aad trimming of the lower branches‚ in order to give head room to the cattle
which are to browse ort the grase below. The whole prunings and thinnings
will eost about el.. and their produce will setch about 121, leaving a profit on
them of about rt. an acre.'’
