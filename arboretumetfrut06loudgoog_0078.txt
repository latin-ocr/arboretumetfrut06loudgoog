Description, dc. In its native counny, the salisbuiis forms a large tres,
like the walnut, but is more conical in rts manner of growth. In England,
in the climate of London, where it is in a favourable soil and situation,
it rises with a 'ht erent trunlr, regularly humislied with alternate
branches, at first incined upwards, but, aa they become older, tahin a
mere horizontal dhention, so as to form a regular, conical‚ and somewhat

Adn'tntum vulgare. They are of the same oulour aud texture on both sides,
ancl resemble, in their smootlmess and parallel linos, those ol a monocotyle·
donous plant. They are somewhat triangular in ahapc, disposed alternately,
like the branches3 wedge-shaped at the base, with stallae as long as the dish:
they are abrupt at the upper extremity,and clowen οι· notched there,in a

were sent from China ιο Μι. Ellis, was found ιο be larger than that of the
pisnchia, with a sarinaceous kernel, haring the flavour of an almond, but
with some degree of arntcrity. The tree grows with considerable rs-
pidity in the climate ol' london, attaining the height of lost. or lssft. in

were newly planted ς and the trec at Tlrthecht, which is sup osed to be between
90 und 1⁰0 years of age, and, consequentiy, the oldest iu urope‚ though not
large, still produces vigorous shoots. The highest tree that we know of in
England is at Purser’s Crosa, where it was planted about 1767, ss we have
