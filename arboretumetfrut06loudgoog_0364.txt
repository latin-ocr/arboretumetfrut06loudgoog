the elm or other trec will extend horizon y, end force the tormer ιο take
a hent position outwards. To us, it appears that this is too servile en imita·
tion of nature, and theta more effective mode would he‚to bend down the
trees as recommended hy Mc. Matthew, orto cut them over, and trent them
in such a manner as to encourage a laterel brooch to becomethe lesder,es
shown in the pertrait ot the Great Larch at Dalwick (fig. 2261. p. 2356.)
Another method, which has been recommended by Snuth and Matthew‚ where
it iswished to gron croolred timber, is, to undermine the trees, so as ιο throw
them over ιο one side, when they have attained a certain height, say from
lt) n. to wit. or 30st.; end leave them in that position ιο recover the pcr-
pendicularity os their leading shoots, hy their annual grovvths.

are small, and the roots only a tnst of libres, he should dig two narrovv ttrrs
about 8 n. long, crossing each other at the middle at right angles, these

turf, end its sostness from being chopped, will cause the plant to throrv out

root; and, if more than one stout root leeder have run out into any ot the
tour trenches, or if any have entered the unetirred earth, they ought all tube
cut except one, the stoutest and most regulm in each trench. ln a few
years afterwards, when the planta have acquired some strength, the earth
should be removed gradually, haring the roots to from 2st. to ιιι. distance

any eide shcots within the distance, should it be hhund that such late root·
pruning does not induce rot. This process ot haring the roots will scarcely
rnjure the growth of the trees, as the roots draw the necessary pabulum from
a considerable distance3 nor, if done caresully, will it endanger their up·
setting ; und the roots, from exposure ιο the air, and freedom from the pressure
of the soil, will swell to en extraordinary size, so as to render them, ere long,
