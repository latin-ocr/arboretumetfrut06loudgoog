largest pinasters which we heve heard ofin ngland are st Westwich House,
Norsollr, the seat ol' J. Petere, Esq. The were planted in 1702, and in 1809
several of thern were measured hy N. ent, Esq„ and found to be upwards
of 80 1ἰ. high, and to contain about eight losds of timber each. (See Trans.
Soc. Arte, vol. xxviii. p. te.)

Geogrnply, History, dc. 'l'he pinaster is indigenous to the soutb oi
Europe, and to both shores os the Mediterraneum ιο Greeoe, the west os
Asis, the Himalayss, and, as it would a pear, even to Chius. lt may be
doubted, however, whether it has not heen carried from Europe to the
latter country. lt is not indigenous to the north of France or Germany,
and is, perhaps, most abundant in Spain, and on the shores of the Mediterra-
neen. It never thrives, except in deep send or sandy losm; and it is said ·
ιο perish when planted in calcareous soil. The pinaster was introduced
into England in 1596, hy Gerard3 and one os the ol est trees still existing is
in the gardens of tbe episcopal palate at Fulham, where, as we have 'seen
above and in p. ts, it was, m 1835, 80 st. high. The pinaster has since been
very extensively planted in Britain, as an ornamental tree; and, in some
parta ol' Hampshrre and Norl'olh, plantatione of it heve been formed on a
large scale for useful purposes. In Hampshire, it has generally sailed,
from tbe soil be' peaty, wet at bottom, shallow, and hard, or the subsoil
being ehallt. In oriols, on the other hand, where it has been planted
in deep sand, the success has been very different. At Westwich House, in
that county, already mentioned, the pinaster began to he planted in 1702; and
many trees, still exmhng there, are rom 70 st. to 80 it. rgb, with trunks pro·

covered with heatb, on a subsoil ol' coarse hard gravel, or dead yellow send.
Nevertheless, on this soil the plante grow so rapidly, that, in 8 or 9 years
aiter yrlarrting, their trunks are frotn lein. to 20 in. round, and some bave
occasionslly made shoots os sn. in length in 2 years. They are planted at
7 st. apert every way, and remaiu unthinned and unpruned till they attain a
circumference of 2st. or ast. Such is the vigour with which these trees

soil again. (Trans. Soe. Aris, vol. xxviii. p. 42.) ln Seotland and lreland,the
pinaster has only been planted as an ornamental tree ς and it thrives‚ in these
countries, in low situations, and near the sea ln France, it cannot he culti-
vated with a view to profit, to the north of Paris; and, even in that latitude,
it is sometimes destroyed by severe winters: for example, in 1788, when a
severe frost killed some large trees on the estate of Mslesherbes. It ahounds
in Saiteerland, where its timber is said to he used in forming shiugle13 and it
iplffinted as an ornamental tree in Germauy, but scarcely thrives north of

The hinet remarkable fact in thesbistory of thia tree is, the great use which
has been made of it in France, in covering immense uacts of barren sand.
This mode of improvement was first commenced in 1780, by M. Bremontier,
of the Administration of Forests, who published a memoir on the subject in
the year 1800, of which we shall make a ver bn'ef abridgement. There are
very extensive downs inseveral countries of lhuropcr arrd the most remarkable
in Franee are those between Dnnlrirk and Nreuport, between Calais and

Boulogne, and between the rivers Adour and Gitonde. Brcrnontiercorn-
