The history 01 the indigenous pins 1088818 18 Scotland is thus given by* Sir
T. D. lauder. Commencing wrth the Western Highlunds, he notices the
remains 011118 Rennoch Forest, ou the confines 01 the greet counties 01 Perth,
lnvemess, and A ll, which, he says, hasbeen ‘⁴ unmercifully slsughtered,”

stretched 188 end wide across the country, meetiug with those which now re-
mein 08 1118 Dee, the Spe , the Findhorn, the Ness,and the Benuley3 88 well
88 those connected with the Glen·mor·ns·elbin, or (irent Cnledoninn Glen,
end with the Glengarry, Lochiel, Glen Neris, sud more western sylvsn dis-
tricts. 01 111888 remnants, none were more extensive, or more esteemed 108

new methods 01 transportinp iton 110818 10 the sce, they introduced the rspid
manufacture end removal 0 11 which altervvards toolr place throughout the
whole 01 the 8 ’1888 districts. About the yenr 1786, 1118 Dukeol Gordon sold
his Glenmore horest to an English company 108 topotl. [lt will be erceived,
11181 there is 8 discrepsncy between this account end thet 01 erigor,
p. 2161, which, however, is 01 80 grest consequence] This was supposed
to be the fiuest fir wood in Scotlnud. Numerone truding vessels, some 01
them 81 above 500 tons burthen, were built from the timber 01 this sorest; and
one frigste, which was called the Glenmore. Many 811118 trees felled men·

part 01 the country: it contained above 16 square miles. Aias! we must
now, indeed, say thet it west 188 1118 high price 01 timber hastened its de-
struction. It went on 108 many years, benevento malre large returns to the
ppoprieton the profits beinlgosometimes above 20,t]001. in one 888. The

oreste 01 Glenmore end thiemurchus, though belonging to 1118888188-

but 8 reduction in the price 01 11811188 will save it 180111 the ruin which hae

The young secdlings come up 88 thiclr 88 they do 18 1118 nurseryrnsn's seed·
