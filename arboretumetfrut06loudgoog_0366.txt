Tle Larclr 111ὶέ11(οόοω 11111011), This insect, according 10 Sang, was
11101 observed by him 00 the larch, at Raith, in Fiieshire, about 17855 but did
not appear to have done any great injury 10 1110 11000. The Duke 01 Athol saw
it first en his trees in 1795, many 01 which, growing in low situations, it de·

their foliage covered over with awhitish substance, which adheres to the tingere

111011 leaves, they appear covered with blackish 010100, both on the trunk y
