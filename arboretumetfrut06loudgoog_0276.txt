foliage is shorter, inore slender, and lighter-coloured, than iu the
following sorm; though the difference may be in part owing to soil
and situation. ln Norway, as we are informed hy hir. white, the
inhabitants make a distinction between the white and the red spruce:
the former grows on light poor soils, and in elevated situations,
and has a lighter foliage, and white wood; the latter grows in
more substantial soils, in the valleys, and has a darker stronger
foliage, and red wood‚ which is more resinous, and ο1 much greater
strength and durability.
