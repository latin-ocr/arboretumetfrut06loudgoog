Ta lor, . A heary fall of snow had been rucoeeded bys portisl thnw

rain, fo lowedb aserere frost, which enreloped “the trees and earth
in 8 thick coeting ofnmsparent ice.'’ The following morning, the accumu-
lstion of ice ou the branchos of the forest trees presented a beautiful sud
exnsordinsrys ctscle. The noblest timbers were every wheretobeseen
hending ben the enormous load of icc with which their brenches were
incrusted‚ and the hesvy icicles which thiclily dependcd from everg' point;

the thickness of the ice, evencii the spra ,often exceeding en inc . The
smallcr trees, from 2011. to even 50 h. in height, were bent to the ground hy
this unwonted burdes, and lay pressing on one another, resembling fields of
gigeiitic corn, beaten down hy s tenipest. Above, the taller trees drooped aud

down showers of icc. The following dayg, lie limbs of the tices began to

Every where eround wesheard the crashin of the brenches ol the loftiest
trees of the forest, which' fell to the with 8 noise like the brechi
of glaes, yet so loud es to malie the woods reeound. As the day 8818888 ,
iiistesd of brenches, whole trees hegen to fell; and, during twenty-four hours,
the scene which took place was ss sublime ss can well he conceived. There
was no wind perceptible yet, notwithstanding the calmness of the day, the
whole forest seemed in motion, fsl' ,wasnug or cnimhling, ss it were,

Under ever tree was 8 rspidly accumulating dehrir of displaced limhs and
branches; eir weight iucreased more than tenfold hy the icc, sud crushing
every thing iri their fall with sudden nnd terrific violence. Altogether, this
spectsole wss one of indescribnble grandeur. The soar, the craekhigand

Another lund of accident to which pine foreste a pesr particularly linble
is their destruction by liter end, in Siberis and in il '

ginstes with man, either purposely oi· by accident ς hut it is supposed some·
times also to he produced hythe action of the sun upon the dry deesyed
wood of fallen trees ; sud sometimes, no doubt, it is the effect of lightning.
