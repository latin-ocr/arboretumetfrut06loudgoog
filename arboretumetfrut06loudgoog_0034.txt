Unite States, aud through a great part of Mexico. In North Amerina, its
most northern point is between Philadelphia and Boston, lat. 43⁰ 30‘ Μ and
it extends westward as far as the Illinois Riser. ‘¹ In the middle, western, and

work written by Francis Hemandez, a Spanish naturalist and hysician‚ who
was sent out by Philip ll3os Spain to examine and describe xiie natural pro-
ductione of Spanish Amerxca. This work, which professed to be a history
of the plenta, animala, and minerals os Mexico, was originally published iu
that country, in Spanish, under the care, and with the neme, of Father
Ximenes ; but it was afterwards republished, in Latin, at Rome, with the name
of the real author attached,in 1651. Dr. Hernundez describes the liquidumbar,

a fragrant gum, which, from its appearance, gave the idea os amber inu
