“ 1. All very rongi Ground, particularly ravines, where the soil is neither
soll rand nor too wet3 also the sides of tbe channels of rapid rivulets. The
roots ol most trees luxuriare in living or flowing water; and, where it is of
salubrious quality, especially when containing a sliqht solution of lime, will
throw themselves out s considerable distance under t estream. The reason
why steep slopes and hills, whose strata are nearly perpendicnlar to the
horizon, are so much affected by larch and other trees, is, because the
moisture in such situations is in motion, and often continues dripping
through the fissures throughout the whole summer. The most desirable
situation 101 larch is where the roots will neither be drowned in stagnant
water in winter, nor parcbed by drought in summan and where the soil is
free from any corrosrve mineral or corrupting monldiness. Larch, in suit·
able soil, 60 years planted, and sessonably tbinned, will have produced doubl
the value 01 what almost any other timber would bave done in the same time
and situation; and, from its general adoptation both for sea andland pur·
poses, it will always command a ready sale.” (Oa Noool Umber, p. 85.)

by the ⁸rot. When this heavy clqjq occupies a steep slope, the larcb will
sometimes succeed well, owing to emore equable supplyoi moisture,and
the water in the soil not stagrrating, but gliding down the declivity. In

on moist back-lying alpina situations, covered towards the south by steep
hills, will sometimes producesound lareh; whereas, did the same saud occu y
