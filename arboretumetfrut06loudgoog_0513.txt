over the suriaco, in the same manner aethe lero does in England. As a single
object on a British lawn, lew, in rarity und singularity, can surpass a handsome
fan palm. A plant has stood out in the open air in the Edinburgh Botanic
(iarden lor several winters, with scarcely· any protection.

species of palm yet known which is likely to make a fine appearance· in the
open air in British gardens. lt may be ohserved, that the dwarf lan palm,
having strong tough fronde, rna be protected throughout the winter without

operation ol' protection. On the other hand, pines-tire, and most dicotyle·
donous lenta, when protected during winter, not only require the frost to he
exclud ,but light aad air to be frequently admitted. A cylindrical frome
ol' rron rods, with a cover lormed of a slightly convex plate ol zinc, manufac-
tured by Messrs. Cottam and Hallen, is well adopted lor protecting plante ol
this kind. The zinc cover throws off

the rain and protecte the plant under it

sides are covered with mats, which can

it were only secondary to the means. lt is true, there has been hitherto a
