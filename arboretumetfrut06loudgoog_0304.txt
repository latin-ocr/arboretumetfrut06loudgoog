Calilornia3 end named by ita diacoverer in honour ol our much esteenied
friend, Archibald Menalca, Esq.; abotanist who has introduced meny valu-
eble species; end who, having discovered many others, of which he was
unable to procure seeds, nearl lt) years ago, has bed the pleasure of seeing
thern et length introduced, ancl brought into general cultivation. Only a very
lew planta ol Α. Menzibsii were raised in the Horticultural Socicty's Garden
in the year 1832, so that the species is at present extremely rere in thie
country; it ia, however, as we are inlormed by Mr. Lawson and Mr. M‘Neb,
jun„ much inore plentilul in Scotland. The plant in the Horticulturnl
Society's Garden is neerl sn. bigh; and there are plants about the sonu
height at Highclere and endon Rectory„ Itisreadilypropageted hy cut·
