The leaves os all the species of pines may be classed according to the num·

and even the species, in the case both of young plante, and of trees without
eones. Allthe Europeanspecies, with the exce tion oi P. Chnbro, have only

huda, eones, and leaves, we consider P. sylvestria, P. Larlcio, P. Pindster,
P. Pinea, P. haleptnsis, and P. Cc‘mbra, as the principle European species, and
the other Euro kinds as only varieties of them. P. austrdlis, P. Thelda,
